This version of the NISE code is actively developed. The structure of the code has been changed compared to previous
versions to allow easier development and contributions. The goal is to include more spectroscopic techniques than
present in previous versions. Feel free to contact the main author if you have ideas for new improvements or additions
or if you developed a code that can be beneficial to add. The contributers to the programme invlove many present and
past members of the Computational Spectroscopy group in Groningen. However, the development has also profitted from the
interaction with the broader spectroscopy community and suggestions for improvements provided, for example, through
issues on the GitHub page are welcome. The team also receive support from the development board currenly involving
Ana Cunha and Thomas la Cour Jansen.
