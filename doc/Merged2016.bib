	abstract = {Two-dimensional infrared Raman spectroscopy is a powerful technique for studying the structure and interaction in molecular and biological systems. Here, we present a new implementation of the simulation of the two-dimensional infrared Raman signals. The implementation builds on the numerical integration of the Schr{\"o}dinger equation approach. It combines the prediction of dynamics from molecular dynamics with a map-based approach for obtaining Hamiltonian trajectories and response function calculations. The new implementation is tested on the amide-I region for two proteins, where one is dominated by {$\alpha$}-helices and the other by {$\beta$}-sheets. We find that the predicted spectra agree well with experimental observations. We further find that the two-dimensional infrared Raman spectra at least of the studied proteins are much less sensitive to the laser polarization used compared to conventional two-dimensional infrared experiments. The present implementation and findings pave the way for future applications for the interpretation of two-dimensional infrared Raman spectra.},

	abstract = {Noticeable differences between the vibrational (IR and Raman) spectra of neat H2O and D2O ice Ih are observed experimentally. Here, we employ our theoretical mixed quantum/ classical approach to investigate these differences. We find reasonable agreement between calculated and experimental line shapes at both high and low temperatures. From understanding the structure of ice Ih and its vibrational exciton Hamiltonian, we provide assignments of the IR and Raman spectral features for both H2O and D2O ice Ih. We find that in H2O ice these features are due to strong and weak intermolecular coupling, not to intramolecular coupling. The differences between H2O and D2O ice spectra are attributed to the significantly stronger intramolecular coupling in D2O ice. Our conclusion for both H2O and D2O ice is that the molecular symmetric and antisymmetric normal modes do not form a useful basis for understanding OH or OD stretch spectroscopy.},

@article{Zhong.2023.J.Chem.Phys..158.064103,
	abstract = {The excitation energy transfer (EET) process for photosynthetic antenna complexes consisting of subunits, each comprised of multiple chromophores, remains challenging to describe. The multichromophoric F{\"o}rster resonance energy transfer theory is a popular method to describe the EET process in such systems. This paper presents a new time-domain method for calculating energy transfer based on the combination of multichromophoric F{\"o}rster resonance energy transfer theory and the Numerical Integration of the Schr{\"o}dinger Equation method. After validating the method on simple model systems, we apply it to the Light-Harvesting antenna 2 (LH2) complex, a light harvesting antenna found in purple bacteria. We use a simple model combining the overdamped Brownian oscillators to describe the dynamic disorder originating from the environmental fluctuations and the transition charge from the electrostatic potential coupling model to determine the interactions between chromophores. We demonstrate that with this model, both the calculated spectra and the EET rates between the two rings within the LH2 complex agree well with experimental results. We further find that the transfer between the strongly coupled rings of neighboring LH2 complexes can also be well described with our method. We conclude that our new method accurately describes the EET rate for biologically relevant multichromophoric systems, which are similar to the LH2 complex. Computationally, the new method is very tractable, especially for slow processes. We foresee that the method can be applied to efficiently calculate transfer in artificial systems as well and may pave the way for calculating multidimensional spectra of extensive multichromophoric systems in the future.},

@article{Zhong.2024.J.Chem.TheoryComput..20.6111,
	abstract = {Two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy (2DES) has proven to be a highly effective technique in studying the properties of excited states and the process of excitation energy transfer in complex molecular assemblies, particularly in biological light-harvesting systems. However, the accurate simulation of 2DES for large systems still poses a challenge because of the heavy computational demands it entails. In an effort to overcome this limitation, we devised a coarse-grained 2DES method. This method encompasses the treatment of the entire system by dividing it into distinct weakly coupled segments, which are assumed to communicate predominantly through incoherent exciton transfer. We first demonstrate the efficiency of this method through simulation on a model dimer system, which demonstrates a marked improvement in calculation efficiency, with results that exhibit good concordance with reference spectra calculated with less approximate methods. Additionally, the application of this method to the light-harvesting antenna 2 (LH2) complex of purple bacteria showcases its advantages, accuracy, and limitations. Furthermore, simulating the anisotropy decay in LH2 induced by energy transfer and its comparison with experiments confirm that the method is capable of accurately describing dynamical processes in a biologically relevant system. This method presented lends itself to an extension that accounts for the effect of intrasegment relaxation processes on the 2DES spectra, which for computational efficiency are ignored in the implementation reported here. It is envisioned that the method will be employed in the future to accurately and efficiently calculate 2D spectra of more extensive systems, such as photosynthetic supercomplexes.},

We present simulation results for the cross-polarized two-dimensional electronic spectra of the lightharvesting system LH2 of purple bacteria. We identify a spectral feature on the diagonal, which we assign to ultrafast coherence transfer between degenerate states. The implication for the interpretation of previous experiments on different systems and the potential use of this feature are discussed. In particular, we foresee that this kind of feature will be useful for identifying mixed degenerate states and for identifying the origin of symmetry breaking disorder in systems like LH2. Furthermore, this may help identify both vibrational and electronic states in biological systems such as proteins and solid-state materials such as hybrid perovskites.},

@article{Jang.2007.J.Phys.Chem.B.111.6807,
	abstract = {This work provides a detailed account of the application of our multichromophoric F\"orster resonance energy transfer (MC-FRET) theory (Phys. Rev. Lett. 2004, 92, 218301) for the calculation of the energy transfer rate from the B800 unit to the B850 unit in the light harvesting complex 2 (LH2) of purple bacteria. The model Hamiltonian consists of the B800 unit represented by a single bacteriochlorophyll (BChl), the B850 unit represented by its entire set of BChls, the electronic coupling between the two units, and the bath terms representing all environmental degrees of freedom. The model parameters are determined, independent of the rate calculation, from the literature data and by a fitting to an ensemble line shape. Comparing our theoretical rate and a low-temperature experimental rate, we estimate the magnitude of the BChl-Qy transition dipole to be in the range of 6.5-7.5 D, assuming that the optical dielectric constant of the medium is in the range of 1.5-2. We examine how the bias of the average excitation energy of the B800-BChl relative to that of the B850-BChl affects the energy transfer time by calculating the transfer rates based on both our MC-FRET theory and the original FRET theory, varying the value of the bias. Within our model, we find that the value of bias 260 cm-1, which we determine from the fitting to an ensemble line shape, is very close to the value at which the ratio between MC-FRET and FRET rates is a maximum. This provides evidence that the bacterial system utilizes the quantum mechanical coherence among the multiple chromophores within the B850 in a constructive way so as to achieve efficient energy transfer from B800 to B850.},

	abstract = {Ultrafast IR spectroscopy is used to monitor the nonequil. backbone dynamics of a cyclic peptide in the amide I vibrational range with picosecond time resoln. A conformational change is induced by means of a photoswitch integrated into the peptide backbone. Although the main conformational change of the backbone is completed after only 20 ps, the subsequent equilibration in the new region of conformational space continues for times >16 ns. Relaxation and equilibration processes of the peptide backbone occur on a discrete hierarchy of time scales. Albeit possessing only a few conformational degrees of freedom compared with a protein, the peptide behaves highly nontrivially and provides insights into the complexity of fast protein folding.},

	abstract = {Chain length and site dependencies of amide I local mode frequencies of R-helical polyalanines are theoretically studied by carrying out semiempirical quantum chemistry calculations. A theoretical model that can be used to quantitatively predict both the local amide I mode frequencies and coupling constants between two different local amide I modes is developed. Using this theoretical model and performing molecular dynamics simulation of an R-helical polyalanine in liquid water, we investigate conformational fluctuation and hydrogen-bonding dynamics by monitoring amide I frequency fluctuations. The instantaneous normal-mode analysis method is used to obtain densities of states of the one- and two-exciton bands and to quantitatively investigate the extent of delocalization of the instantaneous amide I normal modes. Also, by introducing a novel concept of the so-called weighted phase-correlation factor, the symmetric natures of the delocalized amide I normal modes are elucidated, and it is also shown that there is no unique way to classify any given amide I normal mode of the R-helical polyalanine in liquid water to be either A-mode-like or E1-mode-like. From the ensembleaveraged dipole strength spectrum and density of one-exciton states, the amide I infrared absorption spectrum is numerically calculated and its asymmetric line shape is theoretically described. Considering both transitions from the ground state to one-exciton states and those from one-exciton states to two-exciton states, we calculate the two-dimensional IR pump-probe spectra and directly compare them with recent experimental results. A brief discussion on the cross-peaks previously observed in the two-dimensional difference spectrum is presented.},

	abstract = {Classical molecular dynamics (MD) studies of trialanine in aqueous solution are presented. The investigations have been inspired by recent 2D vibrational spectroscopy experiments of Woutersen and Hamm (J. Phys. Chem. B 2000, 104, 11316), who determined the structure and the conformational fluctuations of trialanine. The MD studies include various unbiased 20-ns simulations as well as umbrella sampling calculations of the potential of mean force along the central dihedral angles of trialanine. By employing the GROMOS96 force field, it is predicted that solvated trialanine is predominantly (similar to80%) found in the extended conformations beta and P-II and is also (similar to16%) found in the helix conformation alpha(R). The results are explained by analyzing the free-energy contributions of intra- and intermolecular interactions, calculating the absolute entropy of the trialanine molecule, investigating the solvation and hydrogen bonding of the peptide, and studying the transitions between the extended and helix conformations. Moreover, the vibrational cross-relaxation rates associated with the two amide I modes of trialanine are calculated. The conformational structures and dynamics obtained from the MD studies are shown to be in good overall agreement with experimental data.},

Through temperature-dependent heterodyne optical Kerr effect studies, an upper limit (150 +/- 30 fs extrapolated to 100 degrees C) for the homogeneous lifetime in liquid water was established. The intermediate fifth-order case was analyzed to incorporate this dynamically evolving distribution of local environments and indicates that, even for a system as complex as water, higher-order field correlations can access information on its dynamic structure.},

The model is developed generally, and calculations are applied specifically to temperature-dependent OHD-RIKE measurements of liquid water. The results indicate that the line broadening in the low-frequency vibrational distribution due to the hydrogen-bonded network structure of liquid water is mostly inhomogeneous, with an effective homogeneous relaxation time of 350 fs at 24 degrees C.},

	abstract = {Interrelationships among the coupling between the amide I vibrations of peptide groups, the A-E-1 wavenumber difference of the amide I mode and the conformation of helical polypeptide chains were examined theoretically. Ab initio molecular orbital (MO) calculations were performed for a glycine dipeptide and a glycine tripeptide with various phi and psi angles to obtain the coupling constants between the amide I vibrations of the nearest peptide groups and between those of the second nearest peptide groups. It was found that the coupling constants between the second nearest peptide groups were reasonably well. explained by the transition dipole coupling mechanism, whereas the coupling constants between the nearest peptide groups contained other factors that mainly depended on psi. The wavenumbers of the A and E-1 components of the amide I mode were calculated for various helices on the basis of these coupling constants. The A component is strong in the infrared (IR) spectrum when the transition dipole of the amide I vibration is nearly parallel to the helix axis, whereas the E-1 component has a strong IR intensity when they are nearly perpendicular to each other. The A component has a strong Raman intensity in both cases. Therefore, the Raman-infrared wavenumber difference of 10-20 cm(-1) observed for the amide I bands of poly(L-glutamate) and poly(L-lysine) with charged side chains indicates that these polypeptides, in that so-called 'extended helix' state, have conformations giving rise to strong IR bands of the E-1 component which are lower in wavenumber than the Raman bands of the A component by 10-20 cm(-1). The ranges of the phi and psi angles that are consistent with such spectral features are discussed on the basis of the calculated structures and amide I wavenumbers.
