  abstract = {A simple electrostatic method for the calculation of optical transition energies of pigments in protein environments is presented and applied to the Fenna-Matthews-Olson (FMO) complex of Prosthecochloris aestuarii and Chlorobium tepidum. The method, for the first time, allows us to reach agreement between experimental optical spectra and calculations based on transition energies of pigments that are calculated in large part independently, rather than fitted to the spectra. In this way it becomes possible to understand the molecular mechanism allowing the protein to trigger excitation energy transfer reactions. The relative shift in excitation energies of the seven bacteriochlorophyll-a pigments of the FMO complex of P. aestuarii and C. tepidum are obtained from calculations of electrochromic shifts due to charged amino acids, assuming a standard protonation pattern of the protein, and by taking into account the three different ligand types of the pigments. The calculations provide an explanation of some of the earlier results for the transition energies obtained from fits of optical spectra. In addition, those earlier fits are verified here by using a more advanced theory of optical spectra, a genetic algorithm, and excitonic couplings obtained from electrostatic calculations that take into account the influence of the dielectric protein environment. The two independent calculations of site energies strongly favor one of the two possible orientations of the FMO trimer relative to the photosynthetic membrane, which were identified by electron microscopic studies and linear dichroism experiments. Efficient transfer of excitation energy to the reaction center requires bacteriochlorophylls 3 and 4 to be the linker pigments. The temporal and spatial transfer of excitation energy through the FMO complex is calculated to proceed along two branches, with transfer times that differ by an order of magnitude.},

  abstract = {The interest in the phycoerythrin 545 (PE545) photosynthetic antenna system of marine algae and the Fenna-Matthews-Olson (FMO) complex of green sulfur bacteria has drastically increased since long-lived quantum coherences were reported for these complexes. For the PE545 complex, this phenomenon is clearly visible even at ambient temperatures, while for the FMO system it is more prominent at lower temperatures. The key to elucidate the role of the environment in these long-lived quantum effects is the spectral density. Here, we employ molecular dynamics simulations combined with quantum chemistry calculations to study the coupling between the biological environment and the vertical excitation energies of the bilin pigment molecules in PE545 and compare them to prior calculations on the FMO complex. It is found that the overall strength of the resulting spectral densities for the PE545 system is similar to the experiment-based counterpart but also to those in the FMO complex. Molecular analysis, however, reveals that the origin for the spectral densities in the low frequency range, which is most important for excitonic transitions, is entirely different. In the case of FMO, this part of the spectral density is due to environmental fluctuations, while, in case of PE545, it is essentially only due to internal modes of the bilin molecules. This finding sheds new light on possible explanations of the long-lived quantum coherences and that the reasons might actually be different in dissimilar systems.},

A combination of classical molecular dynamics simulations, quantum chemistry and quantum dynamical calculations is employed to determine the excitation transfer dynamics in PE545. One key property of the light-harvesting system concerning the excitation transfer and dephasing phenomena is the spectral density. This quantity is determined from time series of the vertical excitation energies of the aggregate. In the present study we focus on the quantum dynamical simulations using the earlier QM/MM calculations as input. Employing an ensemble-averaged classical path-based wave packet dynamics, the excitation transfer dynamics between the different bilins in the PE545 complex is determined and analyzed. Furthermore, the nature of the environmental fluctuations determining the transfer dynamics is discussed.},

Global analysis revealed that the dynamics can be summarized in distinct time scales from 200 fs up to 15 ps. While the fastest dynamics with a decay time of {$\sim$}0.2-0.3 ps are relatively temperature-independent, the lifetimes and relative contributions of slower components showed considerable temperature dependence. The slowest time scale of equilibration with the lowest-energy Chl a increased from {$\sim$}5 ps at 295 K to {$\sim$}15 ps at 77 K. The final excited state is independent of initial excitation at 230 K and above, whereas static energy disorder is apparent at lower temperatures. A clear temperature dependence of uphill energy transfer processes was also discerned, which is consistent with the detailed-balance condition.},

  abstract = {Light-harvesting system 2 (LH2) executes the primary processes of photosynthesis in purple bacteria; photon absorption, and energy transportation to the reaction center. A detailed mechanistic insight into these operations is obscured by the complexity of the light-harvesting systems, particularly by the chromophore-environment interaction. In this work, we focus on the effects of the protein residues that are ligated to the bacteriochlorophylls (BChls) and construct potential energy surfaces of the ground and first optically excited state for the various BChl-residue systems where we in each case consider two degrees of freedom in the intermolecular region. We find that the excitation energies are only slightly affected by the considered modes. In addition, we see that axial ligands and hydrogen-bonded residues have opposite effects on both excitation energies and oscillator strengths by comparing to the isolated BChls. Our results indicate that only a small part of the chromophore-environment interaction can be associated with the intermolecular region between a BChl and an adjacent residue, but that it may be possible to selectively raise or lower the excitation energy at the axial and planar residue positions, respectively.},

The stability of the scintillator constituents was determined through fluorescence excitation emission matrix (EEM) spectroscopy and absorption spectroscopy, using parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) as an multivariate analysis tool. By exposing the scintillator liquid to a well-known photon flux at 365 nm and by measuring the decay rate of the fluorescence shifters and the formation rate of their photochemical degradation products, we can place an upper limit on the acceptable photon flux as 1.38 {$\pm$} 0.09 \texttimes{} 10               -11               photon mol L               -1               . Similarly, the oxidative stability of the scintillator liquid was determined by exposure to air at several elevated temperatures. Through measurement of the corresponding activation energy it was determined that the average oxygen concentration would have to be kept below 4.3\textendash 7.1 ppb               w               (headspace partial pressure below 24 ppm               v               ). On the other hand, the thermal stability of the scintillator cocktail in the absence of light and oxygen was remarkable and poses no concern to the SNO+ experiment.},

We consider vibronic coupling that arises through either Franck\textendash Condon activity in which each site in the heterodimer has a local electron\textendash phonon coupling or Herzberg\textendash Teller activity in which the transition dipole moment coupling the sites has an explicit vibrational mode-dependence. We have computed two-dimensional electronic\textendash vibrational (2DEV) spectra for this model while varying the magnitude of these two effects and find that 2DEV spectra contain static and dynamic signatures of both types of vibronic coupling. Franck\textendash Condon activity emerges through a change in the observed excitonic structure, while Herzberg\textendash Teller activity is evident in the appearance of significant side-band transitions that mimic the lower-energy excitonic structure. A comparison of quantum beating patterns obtained from analysis of the simulated 2DEV spectra shows that this technique can report on the mechanism of energy transfer, elucidating a means of experimentally determining the role of specific vibronic coupling mechanisms in such processes.},

Spectroscopic experiments of lysozymes in cosolvents indicate that such changes may arise from the heterogeneous, site-specific hydrophobic interactions between protein surface residues and individual solvent molecules. In pursuit of an accurate and predictive model for explaining biomolecular interactions, we study the averaged structural characteristics of mixed solvents with homologous lysozyme solutes using all-atom molecular dynamics. By observing the time-averaged densities of different aqueous solutions of trifluoroethanol, we deduce trends in the heterogeneous solvent interactions over each protein's surface, and investigate how the homology of protein structure does not necessarily translate to similarities in solvent structure and compositioneven when observing identical side chains.},

  abstract = {Advances in our theoretical approach for describing liquid-state spectroscopy have led to improved results (in comparison with experiment) for 1D and 2D line shapes for dilute HOD in liquid D2O. The theoretical distribution of frequencies has been decomposed into subensembles for different H-bonding environments of the HOD molecules, each of which peak at a different frequency. The still quite substantial breadth of four of these subdistributions is presumably caused in part by different H-bonding configurations of the acceptor and other D2O molecules. Our theoretical results indicate that the fraction of HOD molecules that are single donors is Ϸ27\%, and we suggest that if, in fact, this fraction was significantly higher, the resulting vibrational line shapes would not be compatible with experiment.},

  abstract = {A nitrile-labeled amino acid, p-cyanophenylalanine, is introduced near the active site of the semisynthetic enzyme ribonuclease S to serve as a probe of protein dynamics and fluctuations. Ribonuclease S is the limited proteolysis product of subtilisin acting on ribonuclease A, and consists of a small fragment including amino acids 1-20, the S-peptide, and a larger fragment including residues 21-124, the S-protein. A series of two-dimensional vibrational echo experiments performed on the nitrile-labeled S-peptide and the RNase S are described. The time-dependent changes in the two-dimensional infrared vibrational echo line shapes are analyzed using the center line slope method to obtain the frequency- frequency correlation function (FFCF). The observations show that the nitrile probe in the S-peptide has dynamics that are similar to, but faster than, those of the single amino acid p-cyanophenylalanine in water. In contrast, the dynamics of the nitrile label when the peptide is bound to form ribonuclease S are dominated by homogeneous dephasing (motionally narrowed) contributions with only a small contribution from very fast inhomogeneous structural dynamics. The results provide insights into the nature of the structural dynamics of the ribonuclease S complex. The equilibrium dynamics of the nitrile labeled S-peptide and the ribonuclease S complex are also investigated by molecular dynamics simulations. The experimentally determined FFCFs are compared to the FFCFs obtained from the molecular dynamics simulations, thereby testing the capacity of simulations to determine the amplitudes and time scales of protein structural fluctuations on fast time scales under thermal equilibrium conditions.},

  abstract = {We present a general and comprehensive theoretical and computational framework for modeling ultrafast multidimensional infrared spectra of a vibrational excitonic system in liquid solution. Within this framework, we describe the dynamics of the system in terms of a quantum master equation that can account for population relaxation, dephasing, coherence-to-coherence transfer, and coherence-to-population transfer. A unique feature of our approach is that, in principle, it does not rely on any adjustable fitting parameters. More specifically, the anharmonic vibrational Hamiltonian is derived from ab initio electronic structure theory, and the system-bath coupling is expressed explicitly in terms of liquid degrees of freedom whose dynamics can be obtained via molecular dynamics simulations. The applicability of the new approach is demonstrated by employing it to model the recently observed signatures of coherence transfer in the two-dimensional spectra of dimanganese decacarbonyl in liquid cyclohexane. The results agree well with experiment and shed new light on the nature of the molecular interactions and dynamics underlying the spectra and the interplay between dark and bright states, their level of degeneracy, and the nature of their interactions with the solvent.},

The method is used to identify groups of strongly coupled oscillators to block-diagonalize the Hamiltonians, considerably reducing the expense associated with computing infrared spectra of large proteins. The quality of linear and nonlinear spectra generated from block-diagonal Hamiltonians is demonstrated by comparison with spectra generated from full Hamiltonian trajectories. A library of six proteins reveals that vibrational couplings within hydrogen-bonded residues in specific secondary structures give rise to the characteristic amide I line shapes whereas other couplings play a minor role. Exciton delocalization analyses indicate that amide I vibrations in proteins remain largely localized to groups of less than ten residues.},

  abstract = {Vibrational spectroscopy is an essential tool in chemical analyses, biological assays, and studies of functional materials. Over the past decade, various coherent nonlinear vibrational spectroscopic techniques have been developed and enabled researchers to study time-correlations of the fluctuating frequencies that are directly related to solute-solvent dynamics, dynamical changes in molecular conformations and local electrostatic environments, chemical and biochemical reactions, protein structural dynamics and functions, characteristic processes of functional materials, and so on. In order to gain incisive and quantitative information on the local electrostatic environment, molecular conformation, protein structure and interprotein contacts, ligand binding kinetics, and electric and optical properties of functional materials, a variety of vibrational probes have been developed and sitespecifically incorporated into molecular, biological, and material systems for time-resolved vibrational spectroscopic investigation. However, still, an all-encompassing theory that describes the vibrational solvatochromism, electrochromism, and dynamic fluctuation of vibrational frequencies has not been completely established mainly due to the intrinsic complexity of intermolecular interactions in condensed phases. In particular, the amount of data obtained from the linear and nonlinear vibrational spectroscopic experiments has been rapidly increasing, but the lack of a quantitative method to interpret these measurements has been one major obstacle in broadening the applications of these methods. Among various theoretical models, one of the most successful approaches is a semiempirical model generally referred to as the vibrational spectroscopic map that is based on a rigorous theory of intermolecular interactions. Recently, genetic algorithm, neural network, and machine learning approaches have been applied to the development of vibrational solvatochromism theory. In this review, we provide comprehensive descriptions of the theoretical foundation and various examples showing its extraordinary successes in the interpretations of experimental observations. In addition, a brief introduction to a newly created repository Web site (http:// frequencymap.org) for vibrational spectroscopic maps is presented. We anticipate that a combination of the vibrational frequency map approach and state-of-the-art multidimensional vibrational spectroscopy will be one of the most fruitful ways to study the structure and dynamics of chemical, biological, and functional molecular systems in the future.},

  abstract = {Here we perform a comprehensive study of ultrafast molecular and vibrational dynamics of water confined in small reversed micelles (RMs). The molecular picture is elucidated with two-dimensional infrared (2D IR) spectroscopy of water OH stretch vibrations and molecular dynamics simulations, bridged by theoretical calculations of linear and 2D IR vibrational spectra. To investigate the effects of intermolecular coupling, experiments and modeling are performed for isotopically diluted (HDO in D2O) and undiluted (H2O) water. We put a separation of water inside RMs into two subensembles (water-bound and surfactantbound molecules), observed by many before, on a solid theoretical basis. Water molecules fully attached to the lipid interface (``shell'' water) are decoupled from one another and from the central water nanopool (``core'' water). The environmental fluctuations are largely ``frozen'' for the shell water, while the core waters demonstrate much faster dynamics but still not as fast as in the bulk case. A substantial nanoconfinement effect on the dynamics of the core water is observed after disentanglement of the shell water contribution, which is fully confirmed by the simulations of 2D IR spectra. Current results provide new insights into interaction between biological objects like membranes or proteins with the surrounding aqueous bath, and highlight peculiarities in vibrational energy redistribution near the lipid surface.},

The extent and the time scales of the orientational mobility of the organic cation and the molecular mechanism behind its motion remain unclear, with different experimental and computational approaches providing very different qualitative and quantitative description of the molecular dynamics. Here we use ultrafast 2D vibrational spectroscopy of methylammonium (MA) lead iodide to directly resolve the rotation of the organic cations within the MAPbI3 lattice. Our results reveal two characteristic time constants of motion. Using ab initio molecular dynamics simulations, we identify these as a fast ({$\sim$}300 fs) ``wobbling-in-a-cone'' motion around the crystal axis and a relatively slow ({$\sim$}3 ps) jump-like reorientation of the molecular dipole with respect to the iodide lattice. The observed dynamics are essential for understanding the electronic properties of perovskite materials.},

  abstract = {Spectroscopic techniques can probe molecular systems non-invasively and investigate their structure, properties and dynamics in different environments and physico-chemical conditions. Different spectroscopic techniques (spanning different ranges of the electromagnetic field) and their combination can lead to a more comprehensive picture of investigated systems. However, the growing sophistication of these experimental techniques makes it increasingly complex to interpret spectroscopic results without the help of computational chemistry. Computational molecular spectroscopy, born as a branch of quantum chemistry to provide predictions of spectroscopic properties and features, emerged as an independent and highly specialized field but has progressively evolved to become a general tool also employed by experimentally oriented researchers. In this Primer, we focus on the computational characterization of medium-sized molecular systems by means of different spectroscopic techniques. We first provide essential information about the characteristics, accuracy and limitations of the available computational approaches, and select examples to illustrate common trends and outcomes of general validity that can be used for modelling spectroscopic phenomena. We emphasize the need for estimating error bars and limitations, coupling accuracy with interpretability, touch upon data deposition and reproducibility issues, and discuss the results in terms of widely recognized chemical concepts.},

The source of light in natural habitats has heretofore been thought to be the sun, thus restricting photosynthesis to solar photic environments on the surface of the Earth. If photosynthesis could take place in geothermally illuminated environments, it would increase the diversity of photosynthetic habitats both on Earth and on other worlds that have been proposed to possibly harbor life. Green sulfur bacteria are anaerobes that require light for growth by the oxidation of sulfur compounds to reduce CO               2               to organic carbon, and are capable of photosynthetic growth at extremely low light intensities. We describe the isolation and cultivation of a previously unknown green sulfur bacterial species from a deep-sea hydrothermal vent, where the only source of light is geothermal radiation that includes wavelengths absorbed by photosynthetic pigments of this organism.},

  abstract = {Two-dimensional Raman and hybrid terahertz-Raman spectroscopic techniques provide invaluable insight into molecular structures and dynamics of condensed-phase systems. However, corroborating experimental results with theory is difficult due to the high computational cost of incorporating quantum-mechanical effects in the simulations. Here, we present the equilibrium\textendash nonequilibrium ring-polymer molecular dynamics (RPMD), a practical computational method that can account for nuclear quantum effects on the two-time response function of nonlinear optical spectroscopy. Unlike a recently developed approach based on the double Kubo transformed (DKT) correlation function, our method is exact in the classical limit, where it reduces to the established equilibrium-nonequilibrium classical molecular dynamics method. Using benchmark model calculations, we demonstrate the advantages of the equilibrium\textendash nonequilibrium RPMD over classical and DKT-based approaches. Importantly, its derivation, which is based on the nonequilibrium RPMD, obviates the need for identifying an appropriate Kubo transformed correlation function and paves the way for applying real-time path-integral techniques to multidimensional spectroscopy.},

  abstract = {Following the observation of coherent oscillations in non-linear spectra of photosynthetic pigment protein complexes, particularly phycobilliprotein such as PC645, coherent vibronic transport has been suggested as a design principle for novel light harvesting materials operating at room temperature. Vibronic transport between energetically remote pigments is coherent when the presence of a resonant vibration supports transient delocalization between the pair of electronic excited states. Here, we establish the mechanism of vibronic transport for a model heterodimer across a wide range of molecular parameter values. The resulting mechanistic map demonstrates that the molecular parameters of phycobiliproteins in fact support incoherent vibronic transport. This result points to an important design principle: incoherent vibronic transport is more efficient than a coherent mechanism when energetic disorder exceeds the coupling between the donor and vibrationally excited acceptor states. Finally, our results suggest that the role of coherent vibronic transport in pigment protein complexes should be reevaluated.},

In this paper, we use a series of Frenkel-exciton lattice models to rationalize these results in terms of wave-function localization, interface geometry, and density of states. In one-dimensional co-linear and co-facial models of the interface, increasing local energetic disorder in one phase localizes the interfacial triplet charge-transfer (               3               CT) states and increases the rate at which these states relax to form lower-energy triplet excitons. In two dimensional BHJ models, energetic disorder within the fullerene phase plays little role in further localizing states pinned to the interface. However, inhomogeneous broadening introduces strong coupling between the interfacial               3               CT and nearby fullerene triplet excitons and can enhance the decay of these states in systems with higher degrees of energetic disorder.},

Therefore, there has been growing interest in               in situ               measurements of molecular granularity and heterogeneity through the systematic analysis of vibrational frequency shifts of carbonyl and nitrile infrared probes by vibrational Stark dipole theory. However, here we show that the nitrile vibrational frequency shift induced by its interaction with the surrounding molecules cannot be solely described by electric field-based theory because of the exchange\textendash repulsion and dispersion interaction contributions. Considering a variety of molecular environments ranging from bulk solutions to protein environments, we explore the distinct scenarios of solute-environment contacts and their traces in vibrational frequency shifts. We believe that the present work could provide a set of clues that could be potentially used to design a rigorous theoretical model linking vibrational solvatochromism and molecular topology in complex heterogeneous environments.},

We construct a quantum counterpart of classical friction, a velocity-dependent force acting against the direction of motion. In particular, a translationary invariant Lindblad equation is derived satisfying the appropriate dynamical relations for the coordinate and momentum (i.e., the Ehrenfest equations). Numerical simulations establish that the model approximately equilibrates. These findings significantly advance a long search for a universally valid Lindblad model of quantum friction and open opportunities for exploring novel dissipation phenomena.},

The employed methods are the multichromophoric F\"orster resonance energy transfer (MC-FRET), the numerical integration of the Schr\"odinger equation (NISE), and the Haken-Strobl-Reineker (HSR) model. As a reference, we use the numerically exact Hierarchy of Equations of Motion (HEOM). We examine these methods in various system and bath parameter regimes including the regime relevant to biological light-harvesting systems. We apply them to a model system of a monomeric donor coupled to a multichromophoric acceptor ring of varying size in two limiting configurations, namely symmetric and asymmetric. We find that the symmetric case is more sensitive to the approximations of the methods studied. The NISE method gives the most reasonable results throughout the parameter regimes tested, while still being computationally tractable.},

The design is complicated by the fact that structure\textendash property relationships are hard to establish, because the molecular packing results from a delicate balance of interactions and the excitonic properties that dictate the optics and excited state dynamics, in turn sensitively depend on this packing. Here we show how an iterative multiscale approach combining molecular dynamics and quantum mechanical exciton modeling can be used to obtain accurate insight into the packing of thousands of cyanine dye molecules in a complex double-walled tubular aggregate in close interaction with its solvent environment. Our approach allows us to answer open questions not only on the structure of these prototypical aggregates, but also about their molecular-scale structural and energetic heterogeneity, as well as on the microscopic origin of their photophysical properties. This opens the route to accurate predictions of energy transport and other functional properties.},

  abstract = {We study the exciton localization and resulting optical response for disordered tubular aggregates of optically active molecules. It has previously been shown that such tubular structures allow for excitons delocalized over more than a thousand molecules, owing to the combined effects of long-range dipole\textendash dipole interactions and the higher-dimensional (not truly one-dimensional) nature of the aggregate. Such large delocalization sizes prompt the question to what extent in experimental systems the delocalization may still be determined by the aggregate size (diameter and length) and how this affects the aggregate's optical response and dynamics. We perform a systematic study of the size effects on the localization properties using numerical simulations of the exciton states in a cylindrical model structure inspired by the previously derived geometry of a cylindrical aggregate of cyanine dye molecules (C8S3). To characterize the exciton localization, we calculate the participation ratio and the autocorrelation function of the exciton wave function. We also calculate the density of states and absorption spectrum. We find strong effects of the tube's radius on the localization and optical properties in the range of parameters relevant to the experiment. In addition, surprisingly, we find that even for tubes as long as 750 nm, the localization size is limited by the tube's length for disorder values that are relevant to experimental circumstances, while observable effects of the tube's length in the absorption spectrum still occur for tube lengths up to about 150 nm. The latter may explain the changes in the optical spectra observed during the aging process of bromine-substituted C8S3 aggregates. For weak disorder, the exciton wave functions exhibit a scattered, fractal-like nature, similar to the quasi-particles in two-dimensional disordered systems.},

  abstract = {Ultrafast IR spectroscopy is used to monitor the nonequil. backbone dynamics of a cyclic peptide in the amide I vibrational range with picosecond time resoln. A conformational change is induced by means of a photoswitch integrated into the peptide backbone. Although the main conformational change of the backbone is completed after only 20 ps, the subsequent equilibration in the new region of conformational space continues for times \textquestiondown 16 ns. Relaxation and equilibration processes of the peptide backbone occur on a discrete hierarchy of time scales. Albeit possessing only a few conformational degrees of freedom compared with a protein, the peptide behaves highly nontrivially and provides insights into the complexity of fast protein folding.}

  abstract = {We theoretically investigated the effect of mixed Frenkel (F) and charge transfer (CT) states on the spectral properties of perylene bisimide (PBI) derivatives, focusing on the role of strong electron\textendash phonon interactions. The model consists of a four-level system described by the Holstein Hamiltonian coupled to independent local heat-baths on each site, described by Brownian spectral distribution functions. We employ the reduced hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM) approach to calculate the time evolution of the system and compare it to the pure F exciton cases. We compute the absorption and time-gated fluorescence (TGF) spectra for different exciton transfer integrals and F-CT bandgap conditions. The coherence length of excitons ( N               coh               ) is evaluated employing two different definitions. We observe the presence of an excited hot state peak whose intensity is associated with the delocalization of the excited species and ultrafast dynamics that are solely dependent on the frequency of the local bath. The results indicate that the inclusion of CT states promotes localization of the excitons, which is manifested in a decrease in the intensity of the hot state peak and the 0\textendash 1 peak and an increase in the intensity of the 0\textendash 0 emission peak in the TGF spectrum, leading to a decrease of N               coh               .},

  abstract = {Photosynthesis is a highly optimized process from which valuable lessons can be learned about the operating principles in nature. Its primary steps involve energy transport operating near theoretical quantum limits in efficiency. Recently, extensive research was motivated by the hypothesis that nature used quantum coherences to direct energy transfer. This body of work, a cornerstone for the field of quantum biology, rests on the interpretation of small-amplitude oscillations in two-dimensional electronic spectra of photosynthetic complexes. This Review discusses recent work reexamining these claims and demonstrates that interexciton coherences are too short lived to have any functional significance in photosynthetic energy transfer. Instead, the observed long-lived coherences originate from impulsively excited vibrations, generally observed in femtosecond spectroscopy. These efforts, collectively, lead to a more detailed understanding of the quantum aspects of dissipation. Nature, rather than trying to avoid dissipation, exploits it via engineering of exciton-bath interaction to create efficient energy flow.},

The simulations were performed on model systems having 8 and 27 unit cells, and for a total simulation time of 40 ps in each case. Analysis of the finite size effects, in particular the mobility of the organic component, suggests that the smaller system is overcorrelated through the long-range electrostatic interaction. In the larger system, this finite size artifact is relaxed, producing a more reliable description of the anisotropic rotational behavior of the methylammonium molecules. The thermal effects on the optical properties of the system were also analyzed. The HOMO- LUMO energy gap fluctuates around its central value with a standard deviation of approximately 0.1 eV. The projected density of states consistently place the Fermi level on the p orbitals of the I atoms and the lowest virtual state on the p orbitals of the Pb atoms throughout the whole simulation trajectory.},

The simulations are performed on large supercells containing 768 atoms under isothermal and fully anisotropic isobaric conditions. Two trajectories, one at 300 K and another at 450 K, were extended for over 50 ps in order to perform a detailed assessment of the rotational dynamics of organic cations. The characteristic rotations of the cation are analyzed by defining two rotation axes. It is found that the formamidinium molecules rotate preferentially around the direction parallel to the line connecting the two nitrogen atoms. The rotational dynamics shows some characteristics already observed in methylammonium lead iodide, like the heterogeneous dynamics at room temperature that disappears at 450 K. The orientational probability of the molecules is explored in terms of an expansion in cubic harmonics up to the 12th order. It reveals a strong directionality at room temperature that relaxes when increasing the temperature. These findings are further rationalized using Landau and group theories suggesting a mixed displacive/order\textendash disorder structural instability at lower temperatures.},

  abstract = {Amide I spectroscopy probes the backbone C=O stretch vibrations of peptides and proteins. Amide I spectra are often collected in deuterated water (D2O) since this provides a cleaner background in the amide I frequency range; such data are often referred to as amide I{${'}$} spectra since deuteration induces changes in the mode structure, including a roughly {$\sim$}10 cm-1 redshift. For biological samples, however, deuteration is often not possible. As amide I frequency maps are increasingly applied to quantitative protein structural analysis, this raises the interesting challenge of drawing direct connections between amide I and amide I{${'}$} data. We here analyze amide I and amide I{${'}$} peak frequencies for a series of dipeptides and related compounds. Changes in protonation state induce large electrostatic shifts in the peak frequencies, allowing us to amass a sizable library of data points for direct amide I/amide I{${'}$} comparison. While we find an excellent linear correlation between amide I and amide I{${'}$} peak frequencies, the deuteration-induced shift is smaller for more red-shifted vibrations, indicating different electrostatic tuning rates in the two solvents. H2O/D2O shifts were negligible for proline-containing dipeptides that lack exchangeable amide hydrogens, indicating that the intrinsic properties of the solvent do not strongly influence the H/D shift. These findings indicate that the distinct tuning rates observed for the two vibrations arise from modifications to the intrinsic properties of the amide bond and provide (at least for solvated dipeptides) a simple, linear ``map'' for translating between amide I and amide I{${'}$} frequencies.},

We combine a time-nonlocal quantum master equation formalism and the recently developed method for the efficient calculation of third-order photon echo polarization [M.F. Gelin, D. Egorova, W.J. Domcke, J. Chem. Phys. 123 (2005) 164112] to simulate the 2D electronic spectra of the model system, and compare the time-evolution of the amplitude of cross-peaks to the coherent relaxation dynamics of the system following the excitation by a laser pulse. We show that beats of the upper diagonal peaks in the absolute value 2D spectra provide a direct probe for the coherence dynamics in the system, and the time-evolution of the amplitude of the lower diagonal cross-peaks in the real value 2D spectra can be used to reveal the population transfer among exciton states. Our results verify the intuitive description provided by response functions and demonstrate that the full coherent dynamics in a multichromophoric system can be elucidated using two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy. \'O 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Using experimentally determined parameters and uncorrelated site energy fluctuations, the model predicts oscillations with dephasing times of 1.3 ps at 77 K, which is in a good agreement with the experimental results. These long-lived oscillations originate from the coherent superposition of vibronic exciton states with dominant contributions from vibrational excitations on the same pigment. The oscillations obtain a large amplitude due to excitonic intensity borrowing, which gives transitions with strong vibronic character a significant intensity despite the small Huang-Rhys factor. Purely electronic coherences are found to decay on a 200 fs time scale.},

  abstract = {The structure and dynamics of liquid water are further studied by investigating the bend vibrational mode of HDO/D2O and pure H2O via two-dimensional infrared spectroscopy (2D-IR) and linear absorption. The experimental findings and theoretical calculations support a picture in which the HDO bend is localized and the H2O bend is delocalized. The HDO and H2O bends present a loss of the frequency-frequency correlation in subpicosecond time scale. While the loss of correlation for the H2O bend is likely to be associated with the vibrational dynamics of a delocalized transition, the loss of the correlation in the localized HDO bend appears to arise from the fluctuations/rearrangements of the local environment. Interestingly, analysis of the HDO 2DIR spectra shows the presence of multiple overlapping inhomogeneous distributions of frequencies that interchange in a few picoseconds. Theoretical calculations allow us to propose an atomistic model of the observed vibrational dynamics in which the different in homogeneous distributions and their interchange are assigned to water molecules with different hydrogen-bond states undergoing chemical exchange. The frequency shifts as well as the concentration of the water molecules with single and double hydrogen-bonds as donors derived from the theory are in good agreement with our experimental findings.},

The latter structures, chlorobium vesicles, have been isolated in a partly purified state by differential centrifugation of cell-free extracts. They are associated with a centrifugal fraction that has a very high specific chlorophyll content.

  abstract = {In the previous work of Cotton and Miller [J. Chem. Phys. 145, 144108 (2016)], an improved symmetrical quasi-classical (SQC) windowing model for the molecular dynamics treatment of electronically non-adiabatic processes was developed in order to extend the original SQC approach to the regime of weak-coupling between the electronic states. The improved SQC model\textemdash based on triangular-shaped window functions\textemdash handled the weak-coupling limit as intended and, as a bonus, was shown to be universally superior to the original square/histogram SQC windowing model over all coupling regimes, but only for treating systems of two electronic states, as no higher-dimensional generalization was evident. This paper, therefore, provides a generalized version for treating an arbitrary number of electronic states. By construction, the benefits of the two-state triangle model\textemdash seamless treatment of weak-coupling and improved accuracy in all coupling regimes\textemdash carry over to the generalized version. Far more significant, however, is that the new model provides vastly improved windowing statistics in higher dimensions, enabling the SQC simulation of electronically non-adiabatic processes involving many more relevant electronic states than was previously practical. Capabilities are demonstrated with respect to a 24 pigment trimer model of the Fenna-Matthews-Olson light-harvesting complex, as well as treating similar 48- and 96-electronic state model problems, illustrating the scaling properties of the new method.},

This new femtosecond third-order nonlinear spectroscopy provides the high time and frequency resolutions of existing 2D FT techniques; however, resulting 2D VE spectra contain IR and electronic dipole moment cross terms. We use 2D VE spectroscopy to help understand the vibrational- electronic couplings in the cyanide-bridged transition-metal mixed valence complex [(CN)5FeIICNRuIII(NH3)5]- dissolved in formamide. The amplitudes of the cross-peaks in the 2D VE spectra reveal that three of the intramolecular cyanide stretching vibrations lying along the charge-transfer axis are coherently coupled to the metal-to-metal charge-transfer electronic transition with differing strengths. Analysis of the 2D VE line shapes reveals positive and negative correlations of the cyanide stretching modes with the charge-transfer transition depending on the physical orientation of the vibration in the molecule and its interaction with the solvent. The insights found thus far into the vibronic couplings in the mixed valence model system indicate that the 2D VE technique will be a valuable addition to the existing multidimensional spectroscopy toolbox.},

The amide I band is widely used in infrared spectroscopy of proteins due to the large signal intensity, high sensitivity to hydrogen bonding, and secondary structural motifs. This band has, thus, proven valuable in many studies of protein structure-function relationships. We benchmark spectral simulation protocols using two common force fields in combination with several electrostatic mappings and coupling models. The results are validated against experimental linear absorption and twodimensional infrared spectroscopy for three well-studied proteins. We find two-dimensional infrared spectroscopy to be much more sensitive to the simulation protocol than linear absorption and report on the best simulation protocols. The findings demonstrate that there is still room for ideas to improve the existing models for the amide I band of proteins.},

However, the dynamical structure of such proteins thwarts their study by standard techniques such as X-ray diffraction and NMR spectroscopy. Here, we use a neat liquid composed of N-methylacetamide molecules as a model system to elucidate dynamical and structural properties similar to those one can expect to see in intrinsically disordered proteins. To examine the structural dynamics in the neat liquid, we combine molecular dynamics, response-function-based spectral simulations, and two-dimensional polarization-resolved infrared spectroscopy in the amide I (CO stretch) region. The two-dimensional spectra reveal a delicate interplay between hydrogen bonding and intermolecular vibrational coupling effects, observed through a fast anisotropy decay. The present study constitutes a general platform for understanding the structure and dynamics of highly disordered proteins.},

  abstract = {Structure-based calculations are combined with quantitative modeling of spectra and energy transfer dynamics to detemine the energy transfer scheme of the PE545 principal light-harvesting antenna of the cryptomonad Rhodomonas CS24. We use a recently developed quantum-mechanics/ molecular mechanics (QM/MM) method that allows us to account for pigment-protein interactions at atomic detail in site energies, transition dipole moments, and electronic couplings. In addition, conformational flexibility of the pigment-protein complex is accounted for through molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. We find that conformational disorder largely smoothes the large energetic differences predicted from the crystal structure between the pseudosymmetric pairs PEB50/61C-PEB50/61D and PEB82C-PEB82D. Moreover, we find that, in contrast to chlorophyll-based photosynthetic complexes, pigment composition and conformation play a major role in defining the energy ladder in the PE545 complex, rather than specific pigment-protein interactions. This is explained by the remarkable conformational flexibility of the eight bilin pigments in PE545, characterized by a quasi-linear arrangement of four pyrrole units. The MD-QM/MM site energies allow us to reproduce the main features of the spectra, and minor adjustments of the energies of the three red-most pigments DBV19A, DBV19B, and PEB82D allow us to model the spectra of PE545 with a similar quality compared to our original model (model E from Novoderezhkin et al. Biophys. J. 2010, 99, 344), which was extracted from the spectral and kinetic fit. Moreover, the fit of the transient absorption kinetics is even better in the new structure-based model. The largest difference between our previous and present results is that the MD-QM/MM calculations predict a much smaller gap between the PEB50/61C and PEB50/61D sites, in better accord with chemical intuition. We conclude that the current adjusted MD-QM/MM energies are more reliable in order to explore the spectral properties and energy transfer dynamics in the PE545 complex.},

Polarization-dependent amide I{${'}$}-II{${'}$} 2D IR experiments on poly-L-lysine in the {$\beta$}-sheet, R-helix, and random coil conformations show that a combination of amide I{${'}$} and II{${'}$} diagonal and cross peaks can effectively distinguish between secondary structural content, where amide I{${'}$} infrared spectroscopy alone cannot. The enhanced sensitivity arises from frequency and amplitude correlations between amide II{${'}$} and amide I{${'}$} spectra that reflect the symmetry of secondary structures. 2D IR surfaces are used to parametrize an excitonic model for the amide I{${'}$}-II{${'}$} manifold suitable to predict protein amide I{${'}$}-II{${'}$} spectra. This model reveals that the dominant vibrational interaction contributing to this sensitivity is a combination of negative amide II{${'}$}-II{${'}$} through-bond coupling and amide I{${'}$}-II{${'}$} coupling within the peptide unit. The empirically determined amide II{${'}$}-II{${'}$} couplings do not significantly vary with secondary structure: -8.5 cm-1 for the {$\beta$} sheet, -8.7 cm-1 for the R helix, and -5 cm-1 for the coil.},

It is appreciated that the vibrations governing liquid water's molecular dynamics are delocalized, with nuclear motion evolving coherently over the span of several molecules. Using twodimensional infrared spectroscopy, we have found that the nuclear motions of heavy water, D2O, are qualitatively different than those of H2O. The nonlinear spectrum of liquid D2O reveals distinct O-D stretching resonances, in contrast to H2O. Furthermore, our data indicates that condensed-phase O-D vibrations have a different character than those in the gas phase, which we understand in terms of weakly delocalized symmetric and antisymmetric stretching vibrations. This difference in molecular dynamics reflects the shift in the balance between intra- and intermolecular couplings upon deuteration, an effect which can be understood in terms of the anharmonicity of the nuclear potential energy surface.},

The results show that 2D IR spectroscopy is more sensitive to structural differences between proteins than traditional infrared spectroscopy, providing an observable that allows comparison to quantitative models of protein vibrational spectroscopy. 2D IR correlation spectra of the amide I region of poly-L-lysine, concanavalin A, ribonuclease A, and lysozyme show cross-peaks between the IR-active transitions that are characteristic of amide I couplings for polypeptides in antiparallel hydrogen-bonding registry. For poly-L-lysine, the 2D IR spectrum contains the eight-peak structure expected for two dominant vibrations of an extended, ordered antiparallel {$\beta$}-sheet. In the proteins with antiparallel {$\beta$}-sheets, interference effects between the diagonal and crosspeaks arising from the sheets, combined with diagonally elongated resonances from additional amide transitions, lead to a characteristic ``Z''-shaped pattern for the amide I region in the 2D IR spectrum. We discuss in detail how the number of strands in the sheet, the local configurational disorder in the sheet, the delocalization of the vibrational excitation, and the angle between transition dipole moments affect the position, splitting, amplitude, and line shape of the cross-peaks and diagonal peaks.},

To unravel the main principles of the underlying mechanism on a molecular level, we construct a toy model of electronically coupled donors interacting with a manifold of CT exciton states. In particular, we set up a ladder of CT site energies to model the exciton dissociation. To mimic the complexity of the exciton dynamics at the donor- acceptor interface, the electronic CT manifold is designed to include two vibrational modes that are vibronically coupled to the excitons. We examine the impact of the electronic and vibrational coherences and the structure of the vibronic manifold on the transfer efficiency and charge recombination. Optimal configurations of the vibronic CT manifold are revealed. In particular, the rate of charge recombination can be minimized when the transient dynamics are carefully explored. Such a toy model can be used as a guide for the design of organic materials for efficient photovoltaic devices.},

Here, we present a detailed model to describe the dynamic properties of the amide I and amide II modes and the resulting linear and nonlinear spectra. These two modes have large oscillator strengths, and their mutual coupling plays an important role in their relaxation. Using first-principles calculations of NMA-d7 and a dipeptide in a fluctuating bath described by molecular dynamics simulations, we model the frequencies of the local vibrations as well as the coupling between them. Both the coherent couplings and the fluctuations induced by contact with their environment are taken into account. We apply the resulting model of interacting fluctuating oscillators to study the collective vibrations and the partially coherent transport of vibrational energy through a model R-helix. We find that the instantaneous vibrations are delocalized over a few (up to four) amide units, while the coherences in the helix survive for 0.5-1 ps, leading to coherent transport on a similar time scale.},

These high-frequency vibrations will not only affect the optical response, but also drive the exciton transport. Here, using a model dimer system, the frequency of the underdamped vibration is shown to have a strong effect on the exciton dynamics such that quantum coherent oscillations in the system can be present even in the case of strong noise. Two mechanisms are identified to be responsible for the enhanced transport efficiency: critical damping due to the tunable effective strength of the coupling to the bath, and resonance coupling where the vibrational frequency coincides with the energy gap in the system. The interplay of these two mechanisms determines parameters responsible for the most efficient transport, and these optimal control parameters are comparable to those in realistic light-harvesting complexes. Interestingly, oscillations in the excitonic coherence at resonance are suppressed in comparison to the case of an off-resonant vibration.},

  abstract = {Signatures of nonlinear and non-Gaussian dynamics in time-resolved linear and nonlinear (correlation) 2D spectra are analyzed in a model considering a linear plus quadratic dependence of the spectroscopic transition frequency on a Gaussian nuclear coordinate of the thermal bath (quadratic coupling). This new model is contrasted to the commonly assumed linear dependence of the transition frequency on the medium nuclear coordinates (linear coupling). The linear coupling model predicts equality between the Stokes shift and equilibrium correlation functions of the transition frequency and timeindependent spectral width. Both predictions are often violated, and we are asking here the question of whether a nonlinear solvent response and/or non-Gaussian dynamics are required to explain these observations. We find that correlation functions of spectroscopic observables calculated in the quadratic coupling model depend on the chromophore's electronic state and the spectral width gains time dependence, all in violation of the predictions of the linear coupling models. Lineshape functions of 2D spectra are derived assuming Ornstein-Uhlenbeck dynamics of the bath nuclear modes. The model predicts asymmetry of 2D correlation plots and bending of the center line. The latter is often used to extract two-point correlation functions from 2D spectra. The dynamics of the transition frequency are non-Gaussian. However, the effect of non-Gaussian dynamics is limited to the third-order (skewness) time correlation function, without affecting the time correlation functions of higher order. The theory is tested against molecular dynamics simulations of a model polar-polarizable chromophore dissolved in a force field water.},

  abstract = {Energy equilibration in light-harvesting antenna systems normally occurs before energy is transferred to a reaction center. The equilibration mechanism is a characteristic of the excitation energy transfer (EET) network of the antenna. Characterizing this network is crucial in understanding the first step of photosynthesis. We present our phenomenology-based analysis procedure and results in obtaining the excitonic energy levels, spectral linewidths, and transfer-rate matrix of Light-Harvesting Complex II directly from its 2D electronic spectra recorded at 77 K with waiting times between 100 fs to 100 ps. Due to the restriction of the models and complexity of the system, a unique EET network cannot be constructed. Nevertheless, a recurring pattern of energy transfer with very similar overall time scales between spectral components (excitons) is consistently obtained. The models identify a ``bottleneck'' state in the 664\textendash 668 nm region although with a relatively shorter lifetime ({$\sim$}4\textendash 6 ps) of this state compared to previous studies. The model also determines three terminal exciton states at 675, 677\textendash 678, and 680\textendash 681 nm that are weakly coupled to each other. The excitation energy equilibration between the three termini is found to be independent of the initial excitation conditions, which is a crucial design for the light-harvesting complexes to ensure the energy flow under different light conditions and avoid excitation trapping. We proposed two EET schemes with tentative pigment assignments based on the interpretation of the modeling results together with previous structure-based calculations and spectroscopic observables.},

Over the last decades, ultrafast multidimensional IR approaches using sequences of femtosecond IR pulses have begun to provide a new means of gaining additional information on molecular vibrational couplings, distributions of molecular structures and ultrafast molecular structural dynamics. In this contribution, new approaches to measuring multidimensional spectra involving IR and Raman processes are presented and applied to the study of the amide I band of proteins. Rephasing of the amide I band is observed using dispersed IR-Raman photon echoes and frequency domain 2D-IR-Raman spectra are measured by use of a mid-IR pulse shaper or over a broader spectral range using a tuneable picosecond laser. A simple pulse shaping approach to performing heterodyned time-domain Fourier Transform 2D-IR-Raman spectroscopy is introduced, revealing that the 2D-IR-Raman spectra distinguish homogeneous and inhomogeneous broadening in the same way as the well-established methods of 2D-IR spectroscopy. Across all datasets, the unique dependence of the amide I data on the IR and Raman strengths, vibrational anharmonicities and inhomogeneous broadening provides a fascinating spectroscopic view of the amide I band.},

They are found in certain photosynthetic bacteria, some of which live in extremely low-light environments. In this work, chlorosomes from the green sulfur bacterium Chlorobaculum tepidum were studied by coherent electronic two-dimensional (2D) spectroscopy. Previously uncharacterized ultrafast energy transfer dynamics were followed, appearing as evolution of the 2D spectral line-shape during the first 200 fs after excitation. Observed initial energy flow through the chlorosome is well explained by effective exciton diffusion on a sub-100 fs time scale, which assures efficiency and robustness of the process. The ultrafast incoherent diffusion-like behavior of the excitons points to a disordered energy landscape in the chlorosome, which leads to a rapid loss of excitonic coherences between its structural subunits. This disorder prevents observation of excitonic coherences in the experimental data and implies that the chlorosome as a whole does not function as a coherent lightharvester.},

A customized pulse shaper facilitates shotto-shot modulation at 1 kHz and is employed for rapid scanning over all time delays. A full 2D spectrum with 15 \texttimes{} 15 pixels is obtained in approximately 6 s of measurement time (plus further averaging if needed). Coherent information is extracted from the incoherent fluorescence signal via 27-step phase cycling. We exemplify the technique on cresyl violet in ethanol and recover literature-known oscillations as a function of population time. Signal-to-noise behavior is analyzed as a function of the amount of averaging. Rapid scanning provides a 2D spectrum with a root-mean-square error of {$<$} 0.05 after 1 min of measurement time.},

We found that electronic dephasing occurs within {$\sim$}60 fs and inhomogeneous broadening is approximately 120 cm-1. A three-dimensional global fit analysis allows us to identify several time scales in the dynamics of the 2D spectra ranging from 100 fs to {$\sim$}10 ps and to uncover the energytransfer pathways in LHCII. In particular, the energy transfer between the chlorophyll b and chlorophyll a pools occurs within {$\sim$}1.1 ps. Retrieved 2D decay-associated spectra also uncover the spectral positions of corresponding diagonal peaks in the 2D spectra. Residuals in the decay traces exhibit periodic modulations with different oscillation periods. However, only one of them can be associated with the excitonic cross-peaks in the 2D spectrum, while the remaining ones are presumably of vibrational origin. For the interpretation of the spectroscopic data, we have applied a refined exciton model for LHCII. It reproduces the linear absorption, circular dichroism, and 2D spectra at different waiting times. Several components of the energy transport are revealed from theoretical simulations that agree well with the experimental observations.},

In situations where essential chemical information is contained in spectral peak amplitudes rather than in their detailed shapes, it is possible to dramatically reduce the experimental acquisition time of time domain methods such as two-dimensional infrared (2D-IR) spectroscopy. By introducing compressed sensing to the analysis and experimental design of 2D-IR spectroscopy, we show that waiting-time-dependent 2D peak amplitudes reproduce conventional FT acquisition and analysis but can be recorded in a fraction of the time. Peak amplitude data are often sufficient for measuring intramolecular vibrational redistribution, vibrational coherence, chemical exchange, population, and orientational relaxation, as well as spectral diffusion.},

  abstract = {Here we report the first observation of long-range transport of excitation energy within a biomimetic molecular nanoarray constructed from LH2 antenna complexes from Rhodobacter sphaeroides. Fluorescence microscopy of the emission of light after local excitation with a diffraction-limited light beam reveals long-range transport of excitation energy over micrometer distances, which is much larger than required in the parent bacterial system. The transport was established from the influence of active energy-guiding layers on the observed fluorescence emission. We speculate that such an extent of energy migration occurs as a result of efficient coupling between many hundreds of LH2 molecules. These results demonstrate the potential for long-range energy propagation in hybrid systems composed of natural light harvesting antenna molecules from photosynthetic organisms.},

  abstract = {Pull, pull, pulling electrons along                            Organic photovoltaics operate by transferring charge from a light-absorbing donor material to a nearby acceptor. Falke               et al.               show that molecular vibrations smooth the way for this charge transfer to proceed. A combination of ultrafast spectroscopy and theoretical simulations revealed an oscillatory signal in a model donor/acceptor blend that implicates carbon-carbon bond stretching in concert with the electronic transition. This vibrational/electronic, or vibronic, process maintains a quantum-mechanical phase relationship that guides the charge more rapidly and directly than an incoherent migration from donor to acceptor.

The primary charge-generation mechanism involves a light-induced ultrafast electron transfer from the light-absorbing and electron-donating polymer to the fullerene electron acceptor. Here, we elucidate the initial quantum dynamics of this process. Experimentally, we observed coherent vibrational motion of the fullerene moiety after impulsive optical excitation of the polymer donor. Comparison with first-principle theoretical simulations evidences coherent electron transfer between donor and acceptor and oscillations of the transferred charge with a 25-femtosecond period matching that of the observed vibrational modes. Our results show that coherent vibronic coupling between electronic and nuclear degrees of freedom is of key importance in triggering charge delocalization and transfer in a noncovalently bound reference system.},

The interstate coupling between the potential energy surfaces plays a crucial role in many processes associated with conical intersections. Still no method exists to measure this coupling driving the chemical reactions between the potential energy surfaces involved. In this Letter, using a generic model for photoisomerization, we propose a novel experimental approach to estimate the coupling that mixes the electronic states near a conical intersection. The approach is based on analyzing the vibrational wavepacket of the reactant in the adiabatic ground and excited electronic states. The nuclear wavepacket dynamics are extracted from linear absorption and two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy. Comparing the frequencies of the coupling mode in the adiabatic ground and excited states from models with and without coupling between the potential energy surfaces suggests an experimental tool to determine the interstate coupling.},

This isomerization is known to occur through a conical intersection (CI) and the internal conversion through the CI is known to be vibrationally coherent. Recently measured two-dimensional electronic spectra (2DES) showed dramatic absorptive spectral features at early waiting times associated with the transition through the CI. The common two-state two-mode model Hamiltonian was unable to elucidate the origin of these features. To rationalize the source of these features, we employ a three-state three-mode model Hamiltonian where the hydrogen out-of plane (HOOP) mode and a higher-lying electronic state are included. The 2DES of the retinal chromophore in rhodopsin are calculated and compared with the experiment. Our analysis shows that the source of the observed features in the measured 2DES is the excited state absorption to a higher-lying electronic state and not the HOOP mode.},

  abstract = {Significance             Observation of cross-peaks is one of the hallmark advantages of multidimensional spectroscopy. Often times, cross-peaks overlap with strong diagonal peak features, obfuscating information that is useful for determining molecular structure. Here, we present a polarization scheme that eliminates diagonal peaks, revealing the weaker cross-peak features. This polarization scheme can be applied to one-dimensional transient absorption spectroscopy. As a result, transient absorption spectroscopy can now access information that previously required two-dimensional spectroscopies.           ,                             Two-dimensional (2D) optical spectroscopy contains cross-peaks that are helpful features for determining molecular structure and monitoring energy transfer, but they can be difficult to resolve from the much more intense diagonal peaks. Transient absorption (TA) spectra contain transitions similar to cross-peaks in 2D spectroscopy, but in most cases they are obscured by the bleach and stimulated emission peaks. We report a polarization scheme, {$<$}0\textdegree,0\textdegree,+\texttheta{}               2               (t               2               ),-\texttheta{}               2               (t               2               ){$>$}, that can be easily implemented in the pump-probe beam geometry, used most frequently in 2D and TA spectroscopy. This scheme removes the diagonal peaks in 2D spectroscopies and the intense bleach/stimulated emission peaks in TA spectroscopies, thereby resolving the cross-peak features. At zero pump-probe delay, \texttheta{}               2               = 60\textdegree{} destructively interferes two Feynman paths, eliminating all signals generated by field interactions with four parallel transition dipoles, and the intense diagonal and bleach/stimulated emission peaks. At later delay times, \texttheta{}               2               (t               2               ) is adjusted to compensate for anisotropy caused by rotational diffusion. When implemented with TA spectroscopy or microscopy, the pump-probe spectrum is dominated by the cross-peak features. The local oscillator is also attenuated, which enhances the signal two times. This overlooked polarization scheme reduces spectral congestion by eliminating diagonal peaks in 2D spectra and enables TA spectroscopy to measure similar information given by cross-peaks in 2D spectroscopy.},

  abstract = {We have studied the structure of (Ala)5, a model unfolded peptide, using a combination of 2D IR spectroscopy and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. Two different isotopomers, each bis-labeled with 13CO and 13C18O, were strategically designed to shift individual site frequencies and uncouple neighboring amide-I{${'}$} modes. 2D IR spectra taken under the double-crossed {$\langle\pi$}/4, -{$\pi$}/4, Y, Z{$\rangle$} polarization show that the labeled four-oscillator systems can be approximated by three two-oscillator systems. By utilizing the different polarization dependence of diagonal and cross peaks, we extracted the coupling constants and angles between three pairs of amide-I{${'}$} transition dipoles through spectral fitting. These parameters were related to the peptide backbone dihedral angles through DFT calculated maps. The derived dihedral angles are all located in the polyproline-II (ppII) region of the Ramachandran plot. These results were compared to the conformations sampled by Hamiltonian replica-exchange MD simulations with three different CHARMM force fields. The C36 force field predicted that ppII is the dominant conformation, consistent with the experimental findings, whereas C22/CMAP predicted similar population for {$\alpha$}+, {$\beta$}, and ppII, and the polarizable Drude-2013 predicted dominating {$\beta$} structure. Spectral simulation based on MD representative conformations and structure ensembles demonstrated the need to include multiple 2D spectral features, especially the cross-peak intensity ratio and shape, in structure determination. Using 2D reference spectra defined by the C36 structure ensemble, the best spectral simulation is achieved with nearly 100\% ppII population, although the agreement with the experimental cross-peak intensity ratio is still insufficient. The dependence of population determination on the choice of reference structures/spectra and the current limitations on theoretical modeling relating peptide structures to spectral parameters are discussed. Compared with the previous results on alanine based oligopeptides, the dihedral angles of our fitted structure, and the most populated ppII structure from the C36 simulation are in good agreement with those suggesting a major ppII population. Our results provide further support for the importance of ppII conformation in the ensemble of unfolded peptides.},

  abstract = {Characterizing ensembles of intrinsically disordered proteins is experimentally challenging because of the illconditioned nature of ensemble determination with limited data and the intrinsic fast dynamics of the conformational ensemble. Amide I two-dimensional infrared (2D IR) spectroscopy has picosecond time resolution to freeze structural ensembles as needed for probing disordered-protein ensembles and conformational dynamics. Also, developments in amide I computational spectroscopy now allow a quantitative and direct prediction of amide I spectra based on conformational distributions drawn from molecular dynamics simulations, providing a route to ensemble refinement against experimental spectra. We performed a Bayesian ensemble refinement method on Ala\textendash Ala\textendash Ala against isotope-edited Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy and 2D IR spectroscopy and tested potential factors affecting the quality of ensemble refinements. We found that isotope-edited 2D IR spectroscopy provides a stringent constraint on Ala\textendash Ala\textendash Ala conformations and returns consistent conformational ensembles with the dominant ppII conformer across varying prior distributions from many molecular dynamics force fields and water models. The dominant factor influencing ensemble refinements is the systematic frequency uncertainty from spectroscopic maps. However, the uncertainty of conformer populations can be significantly reduced by incorporating 2D IR spectra in addition to traditional Fourier-transform infrared spectra. Bayesian ensemble refinement against isotope-edited 2D IR spectroscopy thus provides a route to probe equilibrium-complex protein ensembles and potentially nonequilibrium conformational dynamics.},

  abstract = {LOV domains are the light-sensitive portion of plant phototropins. They absorb light through a flavin cofactor, photochemically form a covalent bond between the chromophore and a cysteine residue in the protein, and proceed to mediate activation of an attached kinase domain. Although the photoreaction itself is now well-characterized experimentally and computationally, it is still unclear how the formation of the adduct leads to kinase activation. We have performed molecular dynamics simulations on the LOV1 domain of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and the LOV2 domain of Avena sativa, both before and after the photoreaction, to answer this question. The extensive simulations, over 240 ns in duration, reveal significant differences in how the LOV1 and LOV2 domains respond to photoactivation. The simulations indicate that LOV1 activation is likely caused by a change in hydrogen bonding between protein and ligand that destabilizes a highly conserved salt bridge, whereas LOV2 activation seems to result from a change in the flexibility of a set of protein loops. Results of electrostatics calculations, principal component analysis, sequence alignments, and root mean-square deviation analysis corroborate the above findings.},

  abstract = {Self-replication at the molecular level is often seen as essential to the early origins of life. Recently a mechanism of self-replication has been discovered in which replicator self-assembly drives the process. We have studied one of the examples of such self-assembling self-replicating molecules to a high level of structural detail using a combination of computational and spectroscopic techniques. Molecular Dynamics simulations of self-assembled stacks of peptide-derived replicators provide insights into the structural characteristics of the system and serve as the basis for semiempirical calculations of the UV-vis, circular dichroism (CD) and infrared (IR) absorption spectra that reflect the chiral organization and peptide secondary structure of the stacks. Two proposed structural models are tested by comparing calculated spectra to experimental data from electron microscopy, CD and IR spectroscopy, resulting in a better insight into the specific supramolecular interactions that lead to self-replication. Specifically, we find a cooperative self-assembly process in which {$\beta$}-sheet formation leads to well-organized structures, while also the aromatic core of the macrocycles plays an important role in the stability of the resulting fibers.},

  abstract = {The performance of organometallic perovskite solar cells has rapidly surpassed that of both conventional dye-sensitized and organic photovoltaics. High-power conversion efficiency can be realized in both mesoporous and thin-film device architectures. We address the origin of this success in the context of the materials chemistry and physics of the bulk perovskite as described by electronic structure calculations. In addition to the basic optoelectronic properties essential for an efficient photovoltaic device (spectrally suitable band gap, high optical absorption, low carrier effective masses), the materials are structurally and compositionally flexible. As we show, hybrid perovskites exhibit spontaneous electric polarization; we also suggest ways in which this can be tuned through judicious choice of the organic cation. The presence of ferroelectric domains will result in internal junctions that may aid separation of photoexcited electron and hole pairs, and reduction of recombination through segregation of charge carriers. The combination of high dielectric constant and low effective mass promotes both Wannier-Mott exciton separation and effective ionization of donor and acceptor defects. The photoferroic effect could be exploited in nanostructured films to generate a higher open circuit voltage and may contribute to the current-voltage hysteresis observed in perovskite solar cells.},

They are composed of large numbers of bacteriochlorophylls organized into supramolecular aggregates. We explore the microscopic origin of the fast excitation energy transfer in the chlorosome using the recently resolved structure and atomistic-detail simulations. Despite the dynamical disorder effects on the electronic transitions of the bacteriochlorophylls, our simulations show that the exciton delocalizes over the entire aggregate in about 200 fs. The memory effects associated to the dynamical disorder assist the exciton diffusion through the aggregates and enhance the diffusion coefficients as a factor of 2 as compared to the model without memory. Furthermore, exciton diffusion in the chlorosome is found to be highly anisotropic with the preferential transfer toward the baseplate, which is the next functional element in the photosynthetic system.},

We conclude that theory and experiment collectively paint a relatively complete picture of rotational dynamics within MHPs.

In particular, the rich structural dynamics of these `soft' materials has become a subject of investigation and debate due to their direct influence on the perovskites' optoelectronic properties. Significant effort has focused on understanding the role and behaviour of the organic cations within the perovskite, as their rotational dynamics may be linked to material stability, heterogeneity and performance in (opto)electronic devices. To this end, we use two-dimensional IR spectroscopy (2DIR) to understand the effect of partial caesium alloying on the rotational dynamics of the methylammonium cation in the archetypal hybrid perovskite CH               3               NH               3               PbI               3               . We find that caesium incorporation primarily inhibits the slower `reorientational jump' modes of the organic cation, whilst a smaller effect on the fast `wobbling time' may be due to distortions and rigidisation of the inorganic cuboctahedral cage. 2DIR centre-line-slope analysis further reveals that while static disorder increases with caesium substitution, the dynamic disorder (reflected in the phase memory of the N\textendash H stretching mode of methylammonium) is largely independent of caesium addition. Our results contribute to the development of a unified model of cation dynamics within organohalide perovskites.},

The protein-pigment coupling (part of the environmental effects) is believed to play an important role in determining excitation energy transfer pathways. To study the effect of environment on the electronic transitions in the FMO complex, especially by taking into account the newly discovered eighth extra pigment, we have employed hybrid quantum-mechanics/ molecular-mechanics (QM/MM) methods in combination with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The averaged site energies of individual pigments are calculated using the semiempirical ZINDO/S-CIS method considering the protein residues as atomic point charges along the MD trajectories. The exciton energies are calculated from the site energies and excitonic couplings based on MD simulations. The new eighth pigment displays the largest site energy and contributes mainly to the highest exciton level, which may facilitate transfer of excitation energies from the baseplate to the reaction center. Further, the multimode Brownian oscillator (MBO) model is used to fit the linear absorption spectra of the FMO complex, validating the exciton energies obtained from the QM/MM calculations. Our results indicate that the QM/MM method combined with MD simulations is a powerful tool to model the environmental effects on electronic transitions of light harvesting antenna complexes.},

The structure contains a heptameric ring that is unique among all known LH2 structures, explaining the unusual spectroscopic properties of this bacterial antenna complex. We identify two sets of distinct carotenoids in the structure and describe a network of energy transfer pathways from the carotenoids to bacteriochlorophyll               a               molecules. The geometry imposed by the heptameric ring controls the resonant coupling of the long-wavelength energy absorption band. Together, these details reveal key aspects of the assembly and oligomeric form of purple bacterial LH2 complexes that were previously inaccessible by any technique.},

By numerically exact simulations of SPSP signals for a multilevel vibronic model, we show that the SPSP signals exhibit electronic and vibrational beatings on time scales which are significantly shorter than the pulse durations. This suggests the possible application of SPSP spectroscopy for the realtime investigation of molecular processes that cannot be temporally resolved by pump-probe spectroscopy with weak pump and probe pulses.},

However, not much is known about the influence of the organic dipole rotation and phase transitions on charge carrier dynamics. Here, we report substantial changes in mobility and lifetime of charge carriers in CH3NH3PbI3 after the low-temperature tetragonal ({$\beta$}) to orthorhombic ({$\gamma$}) phase transition. By using microwave conductivity measurements, we observed that the mobility and lifetime of ionized charge carriers increase as the temperature decreases and a sudden increment is seen after the {$\beta-\gamma$} phase transition. For CH3NH3PbI3, the mobility and the half-lifetime increase by a factor of 3-6 compared with the values before the {$\beta-\gamma$} phase transition. We attribute the considerable change in the dynamics at low temperature to the decrease of the inherent dynamic disorder of the organic cation (CH3NH3+) inside the perovskite crystal structure.},

  abstract = {Detailed studies of the excitation dynamics in photosynthetic pigment-proteins require an application of a wide range of spectroscopic methods. From the later part of the previous century, pump\textendash probe and time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy provided an impressive amount of information. Being simple to grasp, these methods are well-understood and widely used by the photosynthesis research community. In the last fifteen years, two-dimensional (2D) spectroscopy was developed. It has significant advantages over other methods, in particular higher temporal resolution available and higher signal-to-noise ratio. Even though it provides considerable opportunities in research, both its experimental realization and theoretical description are rather complicated, making it somewhat difficult to understand and apply. This makes an unfortunate gap in the community, with spectroscopy experts being able to use the technique, but sometimes lacking the relevant biological knowledge, while biologists having that knowledge are dubious about 2D spectroscopy due to the complexity of the approach. This publication is an attempt to fill this gap by providing an accessible introduction to the concepts, principles and possible applications of the 2D spectroscopy, aimed at the biologically trained members of the photosynthesis research community.},

To remedy this issue, we propose pigment arrangement in the trimeric FCP for this species.                        ,                             Diatoms are a major group of algae, responsible for a quarter of the global primary production on our planet. Their adaptation to marine environments is ensured by their light-harvesting antenna \textendash{} the fucoxanthin\textendash chlorophyll protein (FCP) complex, which absorbs strongly in the blue-green spectral region. Although these essential proteins have been the subject of many studies, for a long time their comprehensive description was not possible in the absence of structural data. Last year, the 3D structures of several FCP complexes were revealed. The structure of an FCP dimer was resolved by crystallography for the pennate diatom               Phaeodactylum tricornutum               [W.

Pi               et al.               ,               Science               , 2019,               365               , 6452; R. Nagao               et al.               ,               Nat.

In this Perspective article, we evaluate how precisely these structures may account for previously published ultrafast spectroscopy results, describing the excitation energy transfer in the FCP from another centric diatom               Cyclotella meneghiniana               . Surprisingly, we find that the published FCP structures cannot explain several observations obtained from ultrafast spectroscopy. Using the available structures, and results from electron microscopy, we construct a trimer-based FCP model for               Cyclotella meneghiniana               , consistent with ultrafast experimental data. As a whole, our observations suggest that the structures from the proteins belonging to the FCP family display larger variations than the equivalent LHC proteins in plants, which may reflect species-specific adaptations or original strategies for adapting to rapidly changing marine environments.},

From the picosecond side chain motions to aggregates that form over the course of minutes, characterizing protein structure over these vast lengths of time is important to understanding their function.

In this review, we present some of the basic principles behind 2D IR and show how they have, and can, impact the field of protein biophysics. We highlight experiments in which 2D IR spectroscopy has provided structural and dynamical data that would be difficult to obtain with more standard structural biology techniques. We also highlight technological developments in 2D IR that continue to expand the scope of scientific problems that can be accessed in the biomedical sciences.},

Theory and computations have played an instrumental role in understanding the molecular mechanism of such processes, as they provide a molecular-level insight of structural and electronic changes at ultrafast time scales that often are very difficult or impossible to obtain from experiments alone. Among theoretical strategies, the application of hybrid quantum mechanics and molecular mechanics (QM/MM) models is an important approach that has reached an evident degree of maturity, resulting in several important contributions to the field. This review presents an overview of state-of-the-art computational studies on subnanosecond events in rhodopsins, photoactive yellow proteins, phytochromes, and some other photoresponsive proteins where photoinduced double-bond isomerization occurs. The review also discusses current limitations that need to be solved in future developments.},

Previously, we have utilized a mixed quantum/classical model to calculate vibrational spectroscopic observables for bulk water, ice, the liquid/vapor interface, and small water clusters, as well as water interacting with ions and biological molecules. These studies rely on spectroscopic maps that relate the OH stretching frequency and transition dipole to the local environment around a water molecule. Our spectroscopic maps were parametrized based on water clusters taken from bulk water simulations; in this article, we test the robustness of these maps for water in nonbulk-liquid environments. We find that the frequency, transition dipole, and coupling maps work as well for the water surface, ice Ih, and the water hexamer as they do for liquid water. This suggests that these maps may be generally applied to study the vibrational spectroscopy of water in diverse, potentially heterogeneous environments.},

Ed. 2019, 58, 2899, DOI: 10.1002/anie.201812995) have used unnatural amino acids {$\beta$}-(1azulenyl)alanine (Azu) and azidohomoalanine (Aha) to site-specifically inject and probe vibrational energy in proteins. To aid the interpretation of such experiments, non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations of the anisotropic energy flow in proteins TrpZip2 and PDZ3 domains are presented. On this account, an efficient simulation protocol is established that accurately mimics the excitation and probing steps of Azu and Aha. The simulations quantitatively reproduce the experimentally found cooling times of the solvated proteins at room temperature and predict that the cooling slows by a factor 2 below the glass temperature of water. In PDZ3, vibrational energy is shown to travel from the initially excited peptide ligand via a complex network of inter-residue contacts and backbone transport to distal regions of the protein. The supposed connection of these energy transport pathways with pathways of allosteric communication is discussed.},

  abstract = {Among all photosynthetic organisms, green bacteria have evolved one of the most efficient light-harvesting antenna, the chlorosome, that contains hundreds of thousands of bacteriochlorophyll molecules, allowing these bacteria to grow photosynthetically by absorbing only a few photons per bacteriochlorophyll molecule per day. In contrast to other photosynthetic lightharvesting antenna systems, for which a protein scaffold imposes the proper positioning of the chromophores with respect to each other, in chlorosomes, this is accomplished solely by self-assembly. This has aroused enormous interest in the structure-function relations of these assemblies, as they can serve as blueprints for artificial light harvesting systems. In spite of these efforts, conclusive structural information is not available yet, reflecting the sample heterogeneity inherent to the natural system. Here we combine mutagenesis, polarization-resolved single-particle fluorescence-excitation spectroscopy, cryoelectron microscopy, and theoretical modeling to study the chlorosomes of the green sulfur bacterium Chlorobaculum tepidum. We demonstrate that only the combination of these techniques yields unambiguous information on the structure of the bacteriochlorophyll aggregates within the chlorosomes. Moreover, we provide a quantitative estimate of the curvature variation of these aggregates that explains ongoing debates concerning the chlorosome structure.},

  abstract = {Green sulfur bacteria can grow photosynthetically by absorbing only a few photons per bacteriochlorophyll molecule per day. They contain chlorosomes, perhaps the most efficient light-harvesting antenna system found in photosynthetic organisms. Chlorosomes contain supramolecular structures comprising hundreds of thousands of bacteriochlorophyll molecules, which are properly positioned with respect to one another solely by self-assembly and not by using a protein scaffold as a template for directing the mutual arrangement of the monomers. These two featureshigh efficiency and self-assemblyhave attracted considerable attention for developing light-harvesting systems for artificial photosynthesis. However, reflecting the heterogeneity of the natural system, detailed structural information at atomic resolution of the molecular aggregates is not yet available. Here, we compare the results for chlorosomes from the wild type and two mutants of Chlorobaculum tepidum obtained by polarization-resolved, single-particle fluorescence-excitation spectroscopy and theoretical modeling with results previously obtained from nuclear-magnetic resonance spectroscopy and cryo-electron microscopy. Only the combination of information obtained from all of these techniques allows for an unambiguous description of the molecular packing of bacteriochlorophylls within chlorosomes. In contrast to some suggestions in the literature, we find that, for the chlorosomes from the wild type as well as for those from mutants, the dominant secondary structural element features tubular symmetry following a very similar construction principle. Moreover, the results suggest that the various options for methylation of the bacteriochlorophyll molecules, which are a primary source of the structural (and spectral) heterogeneity of wild-type chlorosome samples, are exploited by nature to achieve improved spectral coverage at the level of individual chlorosomes.},

  abstract = {A reliable intrinsic propensity scale of amino acid residues is indispensable for an assessment of how local conformational distributions in the unfolded state can affect the folding of peptides and proteins. Short host-guest peptides, such as GxG tripeptides, are suitable tools for probing such propensities. To explore the conformational distributions sampled by the central amino acid residue in these motifs, we combined vibrational (IR, Raman, and VCD) with NMR spectroscopy. The data were analyzed in terms of a superposition of two-dimensional Gaussian distribution functions in the Ramachandran space pertaining to subensembles of polyproline II, {$\beta$}-strand, right- and left-handed helical, and {$\gamma$}-turn-like conformations. The intrinsic propensities of eight amino acid residues (x ) A, V, F, L, S, E, K, and M) in GxG peptides were determined as mole fractions of these subensembles. Our results show that alanine adopts primarily ({$\sim$}80\%) a PPII-like conformation, while valine and phenylalanine were found to sample PPII and {$\beta$}-strandlike conformations equally. The centers of the respective {$\beta$}-strand distributions generally do not coincide with canonical values of dihedral angles of residues in parallel or antiparallel {$\beta$}-strands. In fact, the distributions for most residues found in the {$\beta$}-region significantly overlap the PPII-region. A comparison with earlier reported results for trivaline reveals that the terminal valines increase the {$\beta$}-strand propensity of the central valine residue even further. Of the remaining investigated amino acids, methionine preferred PPII the most (0.64), and E, S, L, and K exhibit moderate (0.56-0.45) PPII propensities. Residues V, F, S, E, and L sample, to a significant extent, a region between the canonical PPII and (antiparallel) {$\beta$}-strand conformations. This region coincides with the sampling reported for L and V using theoretical predictions (Tran et al. Biochemistry 2005, 44, 11369). The distributions of all investigated residues differ from coil library and computationally predicted distributions in that they do not exhibit a substantial sampling of helical conformations. We conclude that this sampling of helical conformations arises from the context dependence, for example, neighboring residues, in proteins and longer peptides, some of which is long-range.},

  abstract = {Light sensing by photoreceptors controls phototropism, chloroplast movement, stomatal opening, and leaf expansion in plants. Understanding the molecular mechanism by which these processes are regulated requires a quantitative description of photoreceptor dynamics. We focus on a light-driven signal transduction mechanism in the LOV2 domain (LOV, light, oxygen, voltage) of the blue light photoreceptor phototropin 1 from AVena satiVa (oat). High-resolution crystal structures of the dark and light states of an oat LOV2 construct including residues Leu404 through Leu546 (LOV2 (404-546)) have been determined at 105 and 293 K. In all four structures, LOV2 (404-546) exhibits the typical Per-ARNT-Sim (PAS) fold, flanked by an additional conserved N-terminal turn-helix-turn motif and a C-terminal flanking region containing an amphipathic JR helix. These regions dock on the LOV2 core domain and bury several hydrophobic residues of the central {$\beta$}-sheet of the core domain that would otherwise be exposed to solvent. Light structures of LOV2 (404-546) reveal that formation of the covalent bond between Cys450 and the C4a atom of the flavin mononucleotide (FMN) results in local rearrangement of the hydrogen-bonding network in the FMN binding pocket. These rearrangements are associated with disruption of the Asn414Asp515 hydrogen bond on the surface of the protein and displacement of the N- and C-terminal flanking regions of LOV2 (404-546), both of which constitute a structural signal.},

  abstract = {Chain length and site dependencies of amide I local mode frequencies of R-helical polyalanines are theoretically studied by carrying out semiempirical quantum chemistry calculations. A theoretical model that can be used to quantitatively predict both the local amide I mode frequencies and coupling constants between two different local amide I modes is developed. Using this theoretical model and performing molecular dynamics simulation of an R-helical polyalanine in liquid water, we investigate conformational fluctuation and hydrogen-bonding dynamics by monitoring amide I frequency fluctuations. The instantaneous normal-mode analysis method is used to obtain densities of states of the one- and two-exciton bands and to quantitatively investigate the extent of delocalization of the instantaneous amide I normal modes. Also, by introducing a novel concept of the so-called weighted phase-correlation factor, the symmetric natures of the delocalized amide I normal modes are elucidated, and it is also shown that there is no unique way to classify any given amide I normal mode of the R-helical polyalanine in liquid water to be either A-mode-like or E1-mode-like. From the ensembleaveraged dipole strength spectrum and density of one-exciton states, the amide I infrared absorption spectrum is numerically calculated and its asymmetric line shape is theoretically described. Considering both transitions from the ground state to one-exciton states and those from one-exciton states to two-exciton states, we calculate the two-dimensional IR pump-probe spectra and directly compare them with recent experimental results. A brief discussion on the cross-peaks previously observed in the two-dimensional difference spectrum is presented.}

  abstract = {N-Acylglucosamine is an important component in many oligosaccharides in eukaryotes, where it plays a very important biological role. Located between a glucose ring and an alkyl group of such species is an amide unit (-CONH-), which exhibits an infrared absorption band, mainly due to the CO stretching, in the region of 1600-1700 cm-1, similar to the amide-I band found in polypeptides. In this work, vibrational properties of such an ``amide-I mode'' in Npropionyl-D-glucosamine (GlcNPr) are examined in three typical solvents (water, methanol, and dimethylsulfoxide) by using steady-state infrared and femtosecond infrared dispersed pump-probe spectroscopies. As a result of solute-solvent interactions, multiple structured GlcNPr-solvent clusters are formed in water and methanol but are unlikely in dimethylsulfoxide. The vibrational relaxation rate of the amide-I mode is slightly frequency-dependent, supporting the presence of multiple solvated structures. Further, the amide-I lifetime is significantly shorter in GlcNPr than that in a well-known monopeptide, N-methylacetamide, which can be attributed to the presence of additional downstream vibrational modes caused by the sugar unit. Ab initio molecular dynamics simulations are used to reveal microscopic details of the first solvation shell of GlcNPr. Our results demonstrate that the amide-I mode in glucosamine exhibits both structural and solvent sensitivities that can be used to characterize the three-dimensional arrangement of sugar residues and their structural dynamics in glycopeptides.},

  abstract = {Nonlinear two-dimensional infrared spectroscopy (2DIR) is most commonly simulated within the framework of the exciton method. The key parameters for these calculations include the frequency of the oscillators within their molecular environments and coupling constants that describe the strength of coupling between the oscillators. It is shown that these quantities can be obtained directly from harmonic frequency calculations by exploiting a procedure that localizes the normal modes. This approach is demonstrated using the amide I modes of polypeptides. For linear and cyclic diamides and hexapeptide Z-Aib-L-Leu-(Aib)2-Gly-Aib-OtBu, the computed parameters are compared with those from existing schemes, and the resulting 2DIR spectra are consistent with experimental observations. The incorporation of conformational averaging of structures from molecular dynamics simulations is discussed, and a hybrid scheme wherein the Hamiltonian matrix from the quantum chemical local-mode approach is combined with fluctuations from empirical schemes is shown to be consistent with experiment. The work demonstrates that localized vibrational modes can provide a foundation for the calculation of 2DIR spectra that does not rely on extensive parametrization and can be applied to a wide range of systems. For systems that are too large for quantum chemical harmonic frequency calculations, the local-mode approach provides a convenient platform for the development of site frequency and coupling maps.},

NumPy is the primary array programming library for the Python language. It has an essential role in research analysis pipelines in fields as diverse as physics, chemistry, astronomy, geoscience, biology, psychology, materials science, engineering, finance and economics. For example, in astronomy, NumPy was an important part of the software stack used in the discovery of gravitational waves               1               and in the first imaging of a black hole               2               . Here we review how a few fundamental array concepts lead to a simple and powerful programming paradigm for organizing, exploring and analysing scientific data. NumPy is the foundation upon which the scientific Python ecosystem is constructed. It is so pervasive that several projects, targeting audiences with specialized needs, have developed their own NumPy-like interfaces and array objects. Owing to its central position in the ecosystem, NumPy increasingly acts as an interoperability layer between such array computation libraries and, together with its application programming interface (API), provides a flexible framework to support the next decade of scientific and industrial analysis.},

Natural light harvesting in photosynthesis shows remarkable excitation energy transfer properties, which suggests that pigment\textendash protein complexes could serve as blueprints for the design of nature inspired devices. Mechanistic insights into energy transport dynamics can be gained by leveraging numerically involved propagation schemes such as the hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM). Solving these equations, however, is computationally costly due to the adverse scaling with the number of pigments. Therefore virtual high-throughput screening, which has become a powerful tool in material discovery, is less readily applicable for the search of novel excitonic devices. We propose the use of artificial neural networks to bypass the computational limitations of established techniques for exploring the structure-dynamics relation in excitonic systems. Once trained, our neural networks reduce computational costs by several orders of magnitudes. Our predicted transfer times and transfer efficiencies exhibit similar or even higher accuracies than frequently used approximate methods such as secular Redfield theory.},

  abstract = {We extend traditional two-dimensional (2D) electronic spectroscopy into a third Fourier dimension without the use of additional optical interactions. By acquiring a set of 2D spectra evenly spaced in waiting time and dividing the area of the spectra into voxels, we can eliminate population dynamics from the data and transform the waiting time dimension into frequency space. The resultant 3D spectrum resolves quantum beating signals arising from excitonic coherences along the waiting frequency dimension, thereby yielding up to 2n-fold redundancy in the set of frequencies necessary to construct a complete set of n excitonic transition energies. Using this technique, we have obtained, to our knowledge, the first fully experimental set of electronic eigenstates for the Fenna-Matthews-Olson (FMO) antenna complex, which can be used to improve theoretical simulations of energy transfer within this protein. Whereas the strong diagonal peaks in the 2D rephasing spectrum of the FMO complex obscure all but one of the crosspeaks at 77 K, extending into the third dimension resolves 19 individual peaks. Analysis of the independently collected nonrephasing data provides the same information, thereby verifying the calculated excitonic transition energies. These results enable one to calculate the Hamiltonian of the FMO complex in the site basis by fitting to the experimental linear absorption spectrum.},

  abstract = {The electronic excited states of molecular aggregates and their photophysical signatures have long fascinated spectroscopists and theoreticians alike since the advent of Frenkel exciton theory almost 90 years ago. The influence of molecular packing on basic optical probes like absorption and photoluminescence was originally worked out by Kasha for aggregates dominated by Coulombic intermolecular interactions, eventually leading to the classification of J- and H-aggregates. This review outlines advances made in understanding the relationship between aggregate structure and photophysics when vibronic coupling and intermolecular charge transfer are incorporated. An assortment of packing geometries is considered from the humble molecular dimer to more exotic structures including linear and bent aggregates, two-dimensional herringbone and ``HJ'' aggregates, and chiral aggregates. The interplay between long-range Coulomb coupling and short-range charge-transfer-mediated coupling strongly depends on the aggregate architecture leading to a wide array of photophysical behaviors.},

  abstract = {2D-IR spectroscopy is used to measure protein amide I bands in water, avoiding the need for deuteration. We show that H/D exchange affects protein vibrational relaxation dynamics and that the ability to perform 2D-IR in water enables blood serum protein analysis.           ,                             The amide I infrared band of proteins is highly sensitive to secondary structure, but studies under physiological conditions are prevented by strong, overlapping water absorptions, motivating the widespread use of deuterated solutions. H/D exchange raises fundamental questions regarding the impact of increased mass on protein dynamics, while deuteration is impractical for biomedical or commercial applications of protein IR spectroscopy. We show that 2D-IR spectroscopy can avoid this problem because the 2D-IR amide I signature of proteins dominates that of water even at sub-millimolar protein concentrations. Using equine blood serum as a test system, we investigate the significant implications of being able to measure the spectroscopy and dynamics of proteins in water, demonstrating relevance in areas ranging from fundamental science to the clinic. Measurements of vibrational relaxation dynamics of serum proteins reveals that deuteration slows down the rate of amide I vibrational relaxation by {$>$}10\%, indicating a dynamic impact of isotopic exchange in some proteins. The unique link between protein secondary structure and 2D-IR amide I lineshape allows differentiation of signals due to albumin and globulin protein fractions in serum leading to measurements of the biomedically-important albumin to globulin ratio (AGR) with an accuracy of {$\pm$}4\% across a clinically-relevant range. Furthermore, we demonstrate that 2D-IR spectroscopy enables differentiation of the structurally similar globulin proteins IgG, IgA and IgM, opening up a straightforward spectroscopic approach to measuring levels of serum proteins that are currently only accessible               via               biomedical laboratory testing.},

The low- and high-frequency sides of the hydrogen-bonded (HB) OH stretch band at the interface are selectively excited with special attention to the bandwidth and energy of the pump pulses. Narrow bleach is observed immediately after excitation of the high-frequency side of the HB OH band at {$\sim$}3500 cm-1, compared to the broad bleach observed with excitation of the low-frequency side at {$\sim$}3300 cm-1. However, the time-resolved spectra observed with the two different excitations become very similar at 0.5 ps and almost indistinguishable by 1.0 ps. This reveals that efficient spectral diffusion occurs regardless of the difference of the pump frequency. The experimental observations are well-reproduced by complementary MD simulation. There is no experimental and theoretical evidence that supports extraordinary slow dynamics in the high-frequency side of the HB OH band, which was reported before.},

  abstract = {In our previous work we developed the Finite Field method in order to calculate the fifth-order Raman response. The method was applied to calculate various polarization components of the two-dimensional response of liquid CS2. So far, all calculations relied on the dipole-induced dipole. Accurate time-dependent density functional theory calculations have shown that this model has big discrepancies, when molecules are close together as in the liquid. We now report results of investigations on the importance of multipole and electron overlap effects on the polarizability and the fifth-order Raman response. It is shown that these collision effects, especially the induced multipoles, are crucial in the description of the fifth-order response. The impact is found to be especially pronounced for the {$\chi$}m(5m) zzzz response that is solely due to interaction induced effects. The calculated response will be compared with various experimental results.},

We demonstrate the potential of this method by calculating the spectrum of the trpzip2 b-hairpin peptide, a system that is small enough to allow accurate simulation of its two-dimensional infrared spectra, including vibrational population transfer induced by a fluctuating solvent. The results show that under selected experimental conditions, in particular by using perpendicular polarization and finite waiting times, the cross peaks that constitute the well-known Z-shape marker for b-sheet structure in two-dimensional spectra are strongly enhanced. This enhancement is shown to result from vibrational population transfer. It should be possible to use the same technique for enhancing cross peaks in other structures and generally improve structure determination by two-dimensional infrared spectroscopy. The simulated population transfer times are in good agreement with those observed in experiments on typical proteins.},

  abstract = {The effect of solvent polarizability and multipole effects on the amide I vibrational spectra of a peptide unit is investigated. Four molecular dynamics force fields of increasing complexity for the solvent are used to model both the linear absorption and two-dimensional infrared spectra. It is observed that, at least in chloroform solution, the predicted solvent shift is considerably improved when accounting for the polarizabiltiy and multipole effects. The latter are typically connected with halogen bonding. Significant deviations are still observed for more sensitive line shape parameters such as the spectral width and line skewness. However, the findings demonstrate that previously observed deviations have an origin in the force field treatment rather than in the electrostatic mapping procedure frequently employed to simulate linear absorption and two-dimensional infrared spectroscopy.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we introduce two simple quantum dynamics methods. One is based on the popular surface-hopping method, and the other is based on rescaling of the propagation on the bath ground-state potential surface. The first method is special, as it avoids specific feedback from the simulated quantum system to the bath and can be applied for precalculated classical trajectories. It is based on the equipartition theorem to determine if hops between different potential energy surfaces are allowed. By comparing with the formally exact Hierarchical Equations Of Motion approach for four model systems we find that the method generally approximates the quantum dynamics toward thermal equilibrium very well. The second method is based on rescaling of the nonadiabatic coupling and also neglect the effect of the state of the quantum system on the bath. By the nature of the approximations, they cannot reproduce the effect of bath relaxation following excitation. However, the methods are both computationally more tractable than the conventional fewest switches surface hopping, and we foresee that the methods will be powerful for simulations of quantum dynamics in systems with complex bath dynamics, where the system-bath coupling is not too strong compared to the thermal energy.},

  abstract = {Two-dimensional (2D) vibrational spectroscopy has emerged as one of the most important experimental techniques useful to study the molecular structure and dynamics in condensed phases. Theory and computation have also played essential and integral roles in its development through the nonlinear optical response theory and computational methods such as molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and electronic structure calculations. In this article, we present the fundamental theory of coherent 2D vibrational spectroscopy and describe computational approaches to simulate the 2D vibrational spectra. The classical approximation to the quantum mechanical nonlinear response function is invoked from the outset. It is shown that the third-order response function can be evaluated in that classical limit by using equilibrium or non-equilibrium MD simulation trajectories. Another simulation method is based on the assumptions that the molecular vibrations can still be described quantum mechanically and that the relevant molecular response functions are evaluated by the numerical integration of the Schr\"odinger equation. A few application examples are presented to help the researchers in this and related areas to understand the fundamental principles and to use these methods for their studies with 2D vibrational spectroscopic techniques. In summary, this exposition provides an overview of current theoretical efforts to understand the 2D vibrational spectra and an outlook for future developments.},

The obtained experimental data can be challenging to interpret due to the complexity and potential overlapping spectral signatures. Therefore, computational spectroscopy plays a crucial role in the interpretation and understanding of spectral observables of complex systems. Computational modeling of various spectroscopic techniques has seen significant developments in the past decade, when it comes to the systems that can be addressed, the size and complexity of the sample types, the accuracy of the methods, and the spectroscopic techniques that can be addressed. In this Perspective, I will review the computational spectroscopy methods that have been developed and applied for infrared and visible spectroscopies in the condensed phase. I will discuss some of the questions that this has allowed answering. Finally, I will discuss current and future challenges and how these may be addressed.},

  abstract = {Multidimensional infrared (IR) spectroscopy has emerged as a viable tool to study molecular structure and dynamics in condensed phases, and the third-order vibrational response function is the central quantity underlying various nonlinear IR spectroscopic techniques, such as pump\textendash probe, photon echo and two-dimensional (2D) IR spectroscopy. In this paper, a new computational method is presented that calculates this nonlinear response function in the classical limit from a series of classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, employing a quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) force field. The method relies on the stability matrix formalism where the dipole\textendash dipole quantum mechanical commutators appearing in the exact quantum response function are replaced by the corresponding Poisson brackets. We present the formulation and computational algorithm of the method for both the classical and the QM/MM force fields and apply it to the 2D IR spectroscopy of carbon monoxide (CO) and N -methylacetamide (NMA), each solvated in a water cluster. The conventional classical force field with harmonic bond potentials is shown to be incapable of producing a reliable 2D IR signal because intramolecular vibrational anharmonicity, essential to the production of the nonlinear signal, is absent in such a model. The QM/MM force field, on the other hand, produces distinct 2D spectra for the NMA and CO systems with clear vertical splitting and cross peaks, reflecting the vibrational anharmonicities and the vibrational couplings between the underlying vibrational modes, respectively.},

  abstract = {Inspired by the recent observation of correlated excitation energy fluctuations of neighboring chromophores (Lee et al. Science 2007, 316, 1462), quantum chemistry calculations and molecular dynamics simulations were employed to calculate the electronic\`Avibrational coupling in the excited states of the photosynthetic reaction center of purple bacteria Rhodobacter (Rb.) sphaeroides. The ground states and lowest excited (Qy) states of isolated bacteriochlorophyll a (BChl a) and bacteriopheophytin (BPhe) molecules were first optimized using density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT). Normal mode analyses were then performed to calculate the Huang\`ARhys factors of the intramolecular vibrational modes. To account for intermolecular electronic\`Avibrational coupling, molecular dynamics simulations were first performed. The ZINDO/S method and partial charge coupling method were then used to calculate the excitation energy fluctuations caused by the protein environment and obtain the spectral density. No obvious correlations in transition energy fluctuations between BChl a and BPhe pigments were observed in the time scale of our MD simulation. Finally, by comparing the calculated absorption spectra with experimental ones, magnitudes of inhomogeneous broadening due to the static disorder were estimated. The large amplitude of the static disorder indicates that a large portion of the spectral density and their correlations may still be hidden in the inhomogeneous broadening due to the finite MD simulation time.},

The primary photochemical reaction of vision, the isomerization of retinal in the protein rhodopsin, is known to be a vibrationally coherent reaction, but the Franck-Condon factors responsible for initiating the process have been difficult to resolve with conventional time-resolved spectroscopies. Here we employ experimental and theoretical 2D photon echo spectroscopy to directly resolve for the first time the Franck-Condon factors that initiate isomerization on the excited potential energy surface and track the reaction dynamics. The spectral dynamics reveal vibrationally coherent isomerization occurring on the fastest possible time scale, that of a single period of the local torsional reaction coordinate. We successfully model this process as coherent wavepacket motion through a conical intersection on a {$\sim$}30 fs time scale, confirming the reaction coordinate as a local torsional coordinate with a frequency of {$\sim$}570 cm-1. As a result of spectral features being spread out along two frequency coordinates, we unambiguously assign reactant and product states following passage through the conical intersection, which reveal the key vibronic transitions that initiate the vibrationally coherent photochemistry of vision.},

  abstract = {Absorption and emission line shapes of vibrational and electronic transitions in liquids are broadened by interactions with the ``bath'' (in this case, the rotational and translational degrees of freedom of all the molecules in the liquid). If these degrees of freedom are treated classically, the broadening process is often known as dephasing. If, on the other hand, the bath degrees of freedom are instead treated quantum mechanically, there is additional broadening due to what is known in the chemical-physics literature as decoherence. The question addressed in this paper is the relative importance of decoherence (bath quantum effects) and dephasing. We present general developments of this subject for absorption and emission line shapes, discover several new relationships connecting classical and quantum treatments of the bath, and also consider the Stokes shift (difference in peak frequencies in absorption and emission). We next draw some general conclusions by considering a model system whose transition-frequency time-correlation function has only one bath time scale. We then consider a realistic system of the vibrational OH stretch transition of dilute HOD in liquid D2O at room temperature. For this system, we conclude that bath quantum effects are not very important, except for the Stokes shift. More generally, we argue that this is the case for many vibrational and most electronic transitions in room-temperature liquids.},

Here, we apply recently developed fluorescence detected coherent 2D spectroscopy to study the light harvesting antenna 2 (LH2) of photosynthetic purple bacteria. We report double quantum coherence 2D spectra which show clear cross peaks indicating correlated excitations. Similar results are found for rephasing and nonrephasing signals. Analysis of signal generating quantum pathways leads to the conclusion that, contrary to the currently prevailing physical picture, the two weakly coupled pigment rings of LH2 share the initial electronic excitation leading to quantum mechanical correlation between the two clearly separate absorption bands. These results are general and have consequences for the interpretation of initially created excited states not only in photosynthesis but in all light absorbing systems composed of weakly interacting pigments where the excitation transfer is commonly described by using F\"orster theory. Being able to spectrally resolve the nonequilibrium dynamics immediately following photoabsorption may provide a glimpse to the systems' transition into the F\"orster regime.},

One can avoid the steep scaling associated with the exact simulation of increasingly large quantum systems on conventional computers, by mapping the quantum system to another, more controllable one. In this review, we discuss to what extent the ideas in quantum computation, now a well-established field, have been applied to chemical problems. We describe algorithms that achieve significant advantages for the electronic-structure problem, the simulation of chemical dynamics, protein folding, and other tasks. Although theory is still ahead of experiment, we outline recent advances that have led to the first chemical calculations on small quantum information processors.},

  abstract = {We report a theoretical study of the photoisomerization step in the operating cycle of a prototypical fluorene-based molecular rotary motor (1). The potential energy surfaces of the ground electronic state (S0) and the first singlet excited state (S1) are explored by semiempirical quantum-chemical calculations using the orthogonalization-corrected OM2 Hamiltonian in combination with a multireference configuration interaction (MRCI) treatment. The OM2/MRCI results for the S0 and S1 minima of the relevant 1-P and 1-M isomers and for the corresponding S0 transition state are in good agreement with higher-level calculations, both with regard to geometries and energetics. The S1 surface is characterized at the OM2/MRCI level by locating two S0\`AS1 minimum-energy conical intersections and nearby points on the intersection seam and by computing energy profiles for pathways toward these MECIs. Semiclassical Tully-type trajectory surface hopping (TSH) simulations with on-the-fly OM2/MRCI calculations are carried out to study the excited-state dynamics after photoexcitation to the S1 state. Fast relaxation to the ground state is observed through the conical intersection regions, predominantly through the lowest-energy one with a strongly twisted central CdC double bond and pyramidalized central carbon atom. The excited-state lifetimes for the direct and inverse photoisomerization reactions (1.40 and 1.79 ps) and the photostationary state ratio (2.7:1) from the TSH-OM2 simulations are in good agreement with the available experimental data (ca. 1.7 ps and 3:1). Excited-state lifetimes, photostationary state ratio, and dynamical details of the TSH-OM2 simulations also agree with classical molecular dynamics simulations using a reparametrized optimized potentials for liquid simulations (OPLS) all-atom force field with ad-hoc surface hops at predefined conical intersection points. The latter approach allows for a more extensive statistical sampling.},

The spectra reveal several well-resolved bands that are obscured in the single, broad B850 band observed in conventional absorption measurements on bulk samples. They are interpreted consistently in terms of the exciton model for the circular aggregate of BChl a molecules. From the energy separation between the different exciton transitions a reliable value of the intermolecular interaction is obtained. The spectra of the individual complexes allow for a distinction between the intra- and the intercomplex disorder. In addition to the random disorder, a regular modulation of the interaction has to be assumed to account for all the features of the observed spectra. This modulation has a C2 symmetry, which strongly suggests a structural deformation of the ring into an ellipse.},

  abstract = {There is considerable evidence for the slaving of biomolecular dynamics to the motions of the surrounding solvent environment, but to date there have been few direct experimental measurements capable of site-selectively probing both the dynamics of the water and the protein with ultrafast time resolution. Here, two-dimensional infrared spectroscopy (2D-IR) is used to study the ultrafast hydration and protein dynamics sensed by a metal carbonyl vibrational probe covalently attached to the surface of hen egg white lysozyme dissolved in D2O/glycerol solutions. Surface labeling provides direct access to the dynamics at the protein-water interface, where both the hydration and the protein dynamics can be observed simultaneously through the vibrational probe's frequency-frequency correlation function. In pure D2O, the correlation function shows a fast initial 3 ps decay corresponding to fluctuations of the hydration water, followed by a significant static offset attributed to fluctuations of the protein that are not sampled within the {$<$}20 ps experimental window. Adding glycerol increases the bulk solvent viscosity while leaving the protein structurally intact and hydrated. The hydration dynamics exhibit a greater than 3-fold slowdown between 0 and 80\% glycerol (v/v), and the contribution from the protein's dynamics is found to slow in a nearly identical fashion. In addition, the magnitude of the dynamic slowdown associated with hydrophobic hydration is directly measured and shows quantitative agreement with predictions from molecular dynamics simulations.},

HEWL is systematically crowded alternatively with polyethylene glycol (PEG) or excess lysozyme in order to distinguish the chemically inert polymer from the complex electrostatic profile of the protein crowder. The results are threefold: (1) A sharp dynamical jamming-like transition is observed in the picosecond protein and hydration dynamics that is attributed to an independent-to-collective hydration transition induced by macromolecular crowding that slows the hydration dynamics up to an order of magnitude relative to bulk water. (2) The interprotein distance at which the transition occurs suggests collective hydration of proteins over distances of 30-40 \AA. (3) Comparing the crowding effects of PEG400 to our previously reported experiments using glycerol exposes fundamental differences between small and macromolecular crowding agents.},

  abstract = {The dominant effect in exciton coupling is usually the so-called Coulomb coupling contribution, that is the Coulomb interaction between transition densities of localized excitations. At short distances, Dexter-type exchange effects are discussed to play a role, which are not well described by (semi)local functionals in time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) calculations. Overall, a large effect of the percentage of exact exchange on the resulting exciton splittings is known. Subsystem TDDFT allows one to analyze the exciton coupling mechanism by distinguishing direct from indirect effects, that is, changes in the actual coupling mechanism from modifications in the underlying local excitations. Our analysis shows that the strong influence of exact exchange is not due to a direct Dexter-type (exchange) coupling, but rather to an increased Coulomb (or pseudo-exchange) coupling triggered by a change in transition densities. This is demonstrated in calculations for 2-pyridone and chlorophyll dimers. We finally propose a route to efficient calculations of excited states of large pigment aggregates with hybrid functionals, which so far has been out of reach for quantum chemical methods.},

The light, oxygen, and voltage 2 (LOV2) sensing domain of plant phototropin binds a C-terminal J{$\alpha$} helix that is docked on a {$\beta$}-sheet and unfolds upon light absorption by the flavin mononucleotide (FMN) chromophore. In this work, the signal transduction pathway of LOV2 from Avena sativa was investigated using time-resolved infrared spectroscopy from picoseconds to microseconds. In D2O buffer, FMN singlet-to-triplet conversion occurs in 2 ns and formation of the covalent cysteinyl-FMN adduct in 10 {$\mu$}s. We observe a two-step unfolding of the J{$\alpha$} helix: The first phase occurs concomitantly with Cys-FMN covalent adduct formation in 10 {$\mu$}s, along with hydrogen-bond rupture of the FMN C4O with Gln-513, motion of the {$\beta$}-sheet, and an additional helical element. The second phase occurs in approximately 240 {$\mu$}s. The final spectrum at 500 {$\mu$}s is essentially identical to the steadystate light-minus-dark Fourier transform infrared spectrum, indicating that J{$\alpha$} helix unfolding is complete on that time scale.},

  abstract = {The catalytic activity of proteins is a function of structural changes. Very often these are as minute as protonation changes, hydrogen bonding changes, and amino acid side chain reorientations. To resolve these, a methodology is afforded that not only provides the molecular sensitivity but allows for tracing the sequence of these hierarchical reactions at the same time. This feature article showcases results from time-resolved IR spectroscopy on channelrhodopsin (ChR), light-oxygen-voltage (LOV) domain protein, and cryptochrome (CRY). All three proteins are activated by blue light, but their biological role is drastically different. Channelrhodopsin is a transmembrane retinylidene protein which represents the first light-activated ion channel of its kind and which is involved in primitive vision (phototaxis) of algae. LOV and CRY are flavin-binding proteins acting as photoreceptors in a variety of signal transduction mechanisms in all kingdoms of life. Beyond their biological relevance, these proteins are employed in exciting optogenetic applications. We show here how IR difference absorption resolves crucial structural changes of the protein after photonic activation of the chromophore. Time-resolved techniques are introduced that cover the time range from nanoseconds to minutes along with some technical considerations. Finally, we provide an outlook toward novel experimental approaches that are currently developed in our laboratories or are just in our minds (``Gedankenexperimente''). We believe that some of them have the potential to provide new science.},

Much theoretical progress has been made in computing strongly coupled electronic and nuclear motions at different levels, but how to incorporate them in different spectroscopic signals and the approximations involved are less established. This will be the focus of the present review. We survey a wide range of time-resolved spectroscopic techniques which span from the infrared to the X-ray regimes and can be used for probing the nonadiabatic dynamics in the vicinity of conical intersections. Transient electronic and vibrational probes and their theoretical signal calculations are classified by their information content. This includes transient vibrational spectroscopic methods (transient infrared and femtosecond off-resonant stimulated Raman), resonant electronic probes (transient absorption and photoelectron spectroscopy), and novel stimulated X-ray Raman techniques. Along with the precise definition of what to calculate for predicting the various signals, we outline a toolbox of protocols for their simulation.},

  abstract = {The interplay between the intracellular gate and the selectivity filter underlies the structural basis for gating in potassium ion channels. Using a combination of protein semisynthesis, two-dimensional infrared (2D IR) spectroscopy, and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we probe the ion occupancy at the S1 binding site in the constricted state of the selectivity filter of the KcsA channel when the intracellular gate is open and closed. The 2D IR spectra resolve two features, whose relative intensities depend on the state of the intracellular gate. By matching the experiment to calculated 2D IR spectra of structures predicted by MD simulations, we identify the two features as corresponding to states with S1 occupied or unoccupied by K+. We learn that S1 is {$>$}70\% occupied when the intracellular gate is closed and {$<$}15\% occupied when the gate is open. Comparison of MD trajectories show that opening of the intracellular gate causes a structural change in the selectivity filter, which leads to a change in the ion occupancy. This work reveals the complexity of the conformational landscape of the K+ channel selectivity filter and its dependence on the state of the intracellular gate.},

For the material system, we consider a general electronic-vibrational Hamiltonian, comprising the electronic ground state, a manifold of singly-excited electronic states, and a manifold of doubly-excited electronic states. We show that the calculation of the third-order polarization for particular values of the pulse delay times and in a specific phase-matching direction requires 6 independent WF propagations within the rotating wave approximation. For material systems without optical transitions to doubly-excited electronic states, the number of WF propagations is reduced to 5. The WF EOM-PMA automatically accounts for pulseoverlap effects and allows the efficient numerical calculation of 4WM signals for vibronically coupled multimode material systems. The application of the method is illustrated for model systems with strong electron-vibrational and electronic inter-state couplings.},

Long-range exciton transport in such systems is facilitated by a combination of delocalized excitation wavefunctions (excitons) and exciton diffusion. The unambiguous identification of the exciton transport is intrinsically challenging due to the system's sheer complexity. Here we address this challenge by employing a spectroscopic lab-on-a-chip approach: ultrafast coherent two-dimensional spectroscopy and microfluidics working in tandem with theoretical modeling. We show that at low excitation fluences, the outer layer acts as an exciton antenna supplying excitons to the inner tube, while under high excitation fluences the former converts its functionality into an exciton annihilator which depletes the exciton population prior to any exciton transfer. Our findings shed light on the excitonic trajectories across different sub-units of a multi-layered artificial light-harvesting complex and underpin their great potential for directional excitation energy transport.},

  abstract = {Natural light-harvesting antennae employ a dense array of chromophores to optimize energy transport via the formation of delocalized excited states (excitons), which are critically sensitive to spatio-energetic variations of the molecular structure. Identifying the origin and impact of such variations is highly desirable for understanding and predicting functional properties yet hard to achieve due to averaging of many overlapping responses from individual systems. Here, we overcome this problem by measuring the heterogeneity of synthetic analogues of natural antennae-selfassembled molecular nanotubes-by two complementary approaches: single-nanotube photoluminescence spectroscopy and ultrafast 2D correlation. We demonstrate remarkable homogeneity of the nanotube ensemble and reveal that ultrafast ({$\sim$}50 fs) modulation of the exciton frequencies governs spectral broadening. Using multiscale exciton modeling, we show that the dominance of homogeneous broadening at the exciton level results from exchange narrowing of strong static disorder found for individual molecules within the nanotube. The detailed characterization of static and dynamic disorder at the exciton as well as the molecular level presented here opens new avenues in analyzing and predicting dynamic exciton properties, such as excitation energy transport.},

One such structure arises from the amphiphilic dye C8S3 molecules, which self-assemble in an aqueous medium to a double-wall cylindrical nanotube reminiscent of natural light-harvesting complexes found in green sulphur bacteria. In this paper, we report a way to investigate the structure of inner nanotubes (NTs) alone by dissolving the outer NTs in a microfluidic setting. The resulting thermodynamically unstable system was rapidly frozen, preventing the reassembly of the outer NT from the dissolved molecules, and imaged using cryogenic transmission electron microscopy (cryo-TEM). The experimental cryo-TEM images and the molecular structure were compared by simulating high-resolution TEM images, which were based on the molecular modelling of C8S3 NTs. We found that the inner NT with outer walls removed during the flash-dilution process had a similar size to the parent double-walled NTs. Moreover, no structural inhomogeneity was observed in the inner NT after flash-dilution. This opens up exciting possibilities for functionalisation of inner NTs before the reassembly of the outer NT occurs, which can be broadly extended to modify the intra-architecture of other self-assembled nanostructures.},

The theory is tested by comparison of the predicted spectra of the light-harvesting complex LH2 with experimental data. A qualitative explanation of the strong cross-peaks as compared to conventional two-dimensional electronic spectra is given. The strong crosspeaks are attributed to the clean ground-state signal that is revealed when the annihilation of exciton pairs created on the same LH2 complex cancels oppositely signed signals from the doubly excited state. This annihilation process occurs much faster than the nonradiative relaxation. Furthermore, the line shape difference is attributed to slow dynamics, exciton delocalization within the bands, and intraband exciton-exciton annihilation. This is in line with existing theories presented for model systems. We further propose the use of time-resolved fluorescence-detected two-dimensional spectroscopy to study state-resolved exciton-exciton annihilation.},

Chlorosomes are the light-harvesting organelles of green sulfur and non-sulfur bacteria. They are known to be the most efficient light-harvesting systems in nature. Key to this efficiency is the organization of bacteriochlorophyll molecules in large self-assembled aggregates that define the secondary structure inside the chlorosomes. Many studies have been reported to elucidate the morphology of these aggregates and the molecular packing inside them. It is widely believed that tubular aggregates play an important role. Because the size (radius and length) of these aggregates affects the optical and excitation energy transport properties, it is of interest to be able to probe these quantities inside chlorosomes. We show that a combination of single-chlorosome linear polarization resolved spectroscopy and singlechlorosome circular dichroism spectroscopy may be used to access the typical size of the tubular aggregates within a chlorosome and, thus, probe possible variations between individual chlorosomes that may result, for instance, from different stages in growth or different growth conditions.},

  abstract = {Exciton diffusion plays an important role in many opto-electronic processes and phenomena. Understanding the interplay of intermolecular coupling, static energetic disorder, and dephasing caused by environmental fluctuations (dynamic disorder) is crucial to optimize exciton diffusion under various physical conditions. We report on a systematic analysis of the exciton diffusion constant in linear aggregates using the Haken\textendash Strobl\textendash Reineker model to describe this interplay. We numerically investigate the static-disorder scaling of (i) the diffusion constant in the limit of small dephasing rate, (ii) the dephasing rate at which the diffusion is optimized, and (iii) the value of the diffusion constant at the optimal dephasing rate. Three scaling regimes are found, associated with, respectively, fully delocalized exciton states (finite-size effects), weakly localized states, and strongly localized states. The scaling powers agree well with analytically estimated ones. In particular, in the weakly localized regime, the numerical results corroborate the so-called quantum Goldilocks principle to find the optimal dephasing rate and maximum diffusion constant as a function of static disorder, while in the strong-localization regime, these quantities can be derived fully analytically.},

  abstract = {Biophysical studies of membrane proteins through spectroscopic methods often require that the protein be extracted from its lipid environment and solubilized. Liquid chloroform is one of several organic cosolvents that is successfully used for this purpose. However, our understanding of the influence of such environments on the structure and dynamics of proteins is far from complete. Atomically-detailed molecular simulations may provide valuable insights to help interpret the experimental data derived from these complex systems, provided that appropriate developments in the existing force-fields are made. In this communication we present a novel polarizable model for chloroform, based on classical Drude oscillators. This model was calibrated to reproduce the vaporization enthalpy, density, static dielectric constant and self-diffusion constant of the pure liquid at ambient conditions.},

Here we report quasielastic neutron scattering measurements showing that dipolar CH               3               NH               3               +               ions reorientate between the faces, corners or edges of the pseudo-cubic lattice cages in CH               3               NH               3               PbI               3               crystals with a room temperature residence time of {$\sim$}14\,ps.

In this study, FTIR, two-dimensional IR spectroscopy and molecular dynamics simulations were employed to characterize the varying turn conformations that exist in the GVGXLPGVG family of disordered peptides. This analysis revealed that changing the size of the side chain at the X amino acid site from Gly to Ala to Val substantially alters the conformation of the peptide. To quantify this effect, proline peak shifts and intensity changes were compared to a structure-based spectroscopic model. These simulated spectra were used to assign the population of type-II {$\beta$} turns, bulged turns, and irregular {$\beta$} turns for each peptide. Of particular interest was the Val variant commonly found in the protein elastin, which contained a 25\% population of irregular {$\beta$} turns containing two peptide hydrogen bonds to the proline CO.},

A fully quantitative theory of the relationship between protein conformation and optical spectroscopy would facilitate deeper interpretation of and insight into biophysical and simulation studies of protein dynamics and folding. We have developed new models of the aromatic side chain chromophores toluene,               p               -cresol and 3-methylindole, which incorporate               ab initio               calculations of the Franck\textendash Condon effect into first principles calculations of CD using an exciton approach. The near-UV CD spectra of 40 proteins are calculated with the new parameter set and the correlation between the computed and the experimental intensity from 270 to 290 nm is much improved. The contribution of individual chromophores to the CD spectra has been calculated for several mutants and in many cases helps rationalize changes in their experimental spectra. Considering conformational flexibility by using families of NMR structures leads to further improvements for some proteins and illustrates an informative level of sensitivity to side chain conformation. In several cases, the near-UV CD calculations can distinguish the native protein structure from a set of computer-generated misfolded decoy structures.},

  abstract = {Chlorosome antennae form an interesting class of materials for studying the role of structural motifs and dynamics in nonadiabatic energy transfer. They perform robust and highly quantum-efficient transfer of excitonic energy while allowing for compositional variation and completely lacking the usual regulatory proteins. Here, we first cast the geometrical analysis for ideal tubular scaffolding models into a formal framework, to relate effective helical properties of the assembly structures to established characterization data for various types of chlorosomes. This analysis shows that helicity is uniquely defined for chlorosomes composed of bacteriochlorophyll (BChl) d and that three chiral angles are consistent with the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and electron microscope data for BChl c, including two novel ones that are at variance with current interpretations of optical data based on perfect cylindrical symmetry. We use this information as a starting point for investigating dynamic and static heterogeneity at the molecular level by unconstrained molecular dynamics. We first identify a rotational degree of freedom, along the Mg-OH coordination bond, that alternates along the syn-anti stacks and underlies the (flexible) curvature on a larger scale. Because rotation directly relates to the formation or breaking of interstack hydrogen bonds of the O-H{$\cdot\cdot\cdot$}OC structural motif along the syn-anti stacks, we analyzed the relative fractions of hydrogen-bonded and the nonbonded regions, forming stripe domains in otherwise spectroscopically homogeneous curved slabs. The ratios 7:3 for BChl c and 9:1 for BChl d for the two distinct structural components agree well with the signal intensities determined by NMR. In addition, rotation with curvature-independent formation of stripe domains offers a viable explanation for the localization and dispersion of exciton states over two fractions, as observed in single chlorosome fluorescence decay studies.},

A Trotter type of approximation is used for the matrix exponent that describes the time evolution of the quantum system. This is needed for calculating the third-order response functions governing the two-dimensional infrared and visible spectra. The method is tested on a model dimer system, the amide I spectrum of the Gramicidin A antimicrobial peptide, the spectrum of the OH stretching vibration of bulk water, and a homogeneous J-aggregate. Errors due to the approximation are hardly observable in the calculated spectra. Scaling simulations with different system sizes are used to demonstrate that the new scheme is indeed scaling with the system size to the third power, one order faster than the existing methods.},

Proton transport processes in proton channels are involved in numerous fundamental biochemical reactions. However, probing the proton transport process at the molecular level is challenging, because of the limitation in both spatial and time resolution of the traditional experimental approaches. In this paper, we perform proton transport molecular dynamics simulations and model the amide I region of the 2DIR spectrum of a proton channel to examine its sensitivity to the proton transport process. We first report the position dependent proton transfer rates along the channel. The rates in the middle of the channel are larger than those in the entrance. In the presence of protons, we find that the antidiagonal line width of the 2DIR spectrum is larger, and the time evolution of the 2DIR spectrum is slower than that without proton. The time evolution of the 2DIR spectrum with different isotope-labeled residues is similar, even if the local proton transfer rates are different. This results from the proton hopping and the channel water rotation being collective mechanisms, and these effects are convoluted in the spectra.},

We apply the simulation to the amide I band of a mechanosensitive channel protein. By examining the signal generated from different segments of the protein, we find that the overall signal is impossible to interpret without the aid of simulations due to the interference of the response generated on different segments of the protein. We do not find significant cross-peaks in the spectra, even when the waiting time is increased. The spectra are thus not sensitive to coupling between different structural elements. Despite this, we conclude that two-dimensional sum frequency generation spectroscopy will be a powerful tool to investigate membrane bound proteins.},

Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations provide a powerful toolkit to investigate dynamical processes in (bio)molecular ensembles from the (sub)picosecond to the (sub)millisecond regime and from the \AA{} to hundreds of nm length scale. Therefore, MD is well suited to address a variety of questions arising in the field of photosynthesis research. In this review, we provide an introduction to the basic concepts of MD simulations, at atomistic and coarse-grained level of resolution. Furthermore, we discuss applications of MD simulations to model photosynthetic systems of different sizes and complexity and their connection to experimental observables. Finally, we provide a brief glance on which methods provide opportunities to capture phenomena beyond the applicability of classical MD.},

  abstract = {The theory of fluorescent emission anisotropy [r(t)] of a cylindrical probe in a membrane suspension is developed. It is shown, independent of any model, that the limiting anisotropy [r(oo)] is proportional to the square of the order parameter of the probe. The order parameter determines the first nontrivial term in the expansion of the equilibrium orientational distribution function of the probe in a series of Legendre polynomials. Following Kinosita, Kawato, and Ikegami, the motion of the probe is described as diffusion ("wobbling") within a cone of semiangle 00. Within the framework of this model, an accurate singleexponential approximation for r(t) is considered. An analytic expression relating the effective relaxation time, which appears in the above approximation, to 00 and the diffusion coefficient for wobbling is derived. The model is generalized to the situation where the probe is attached to a macromolecule whose motion cannot be neglected on the time scale of the fluorescence experiment. Finally, by exploiting the formal similarity between the theory of fluorescence depolarization and '3C-NMR dipolar relaxation, expressions for T,, T2, and the nuclear Overhauser enhancement are derived for a protonated carbon which is nonrigidly attached to a macromolecule and undergoes librational motion described as diffusion on a spherical "cap" of semiangle 00.},

Some of these materials are room-temperature ferroelectrics. The presence of switchable ferroelectric domains in methylammonium lead triiodide, CH3NH3PbI3, has recently been observed via piezoresponse force microscopy. Here, we focus on the structural and electronic properties of ferroelectric domain walls in CH3NH3PbX3 (X = Cl, Br, I). We find that organometal halide perovskites can form both charged and uncharged domain walls due to the flexible orientational order of the organic molecules. The electronic band gaps for domain structures possessing 180 and 90\textdegree{} walls are estimated with density functional theory. It is found that the presence of charged domain walls will significantly reduce the band gap by 20-40\%, while the presence of uncharged domain walls has no substantial impact on the band gap. We demonstrate that charged domain walls can serve as segregated channels for the motions of charge carriers. These results highlight the importance of ferroelectric domain walls in hybrid perovskites for photovoltaic applications and suggest a possible avenue for device optimization through domain patterning.},

Fullerene derivatives bearing either an alkyl side chain or ethylene glycol (EG) side chains of different lengths are used as the host molecules for molecular doping. It is found that the polar EG side chains can enable better miscibility with the polar dopant than the alkyl side chain, which leads to more than 5-fold enhancement of doping efficiency. Beyond the doping efficiency, another crucial parameter of molecular doping, the molecular order, is readily acquired by simultaneous control of the polarity and the length of the side chain. A polar side chain with an appropriate chain length can contribute to increasing Seebeck coefficients of doped fullerene derivatives more effectively than an alkyl side chain, likely due to the resultant good miscibility and high molecular order. As a result, an optimized power factor of 23.1 {$\mu$}W m-1 K-2 is achieved in the fullerene derivative with a tetraethylene glycol side chain. This represents one of the best n-type organic thermoelectrics. Additionally, EG side chains can improve the air stability of n-doped fullerene derivatives films as compared to an alkyl side chain. Our work sheds light on the design of side-chains in efficient n-type small molecules thermoelectric materials and contributes to the understanding of their thermoelectric properties.},

These assemblies are based on zinc chlorin monomers and are considered as model systems that resemble the secondary structural elements in the natural light-harvesting systems of green (non) sulfur bacteria. Compared to the natural systems, the spectral parameters extracted from the single-nanotube spectra feature distributions with significantly smaller widths, which is ascribed to a tremendous reduction of structural heterogeneity in the artificial systems. Employing quantum chemical molecular modeling the spectra of individual nanotubes can be explained consistently only for a molecular packing model that is fundamentally different from those considered so far for the natural systems. Subsequent theoretical simulations reveal that the remaining spectral variations between single nanotubes can be traced back to small variations of the mutual orientations of the monomer transition dipole moments that are far beyond the resolving power of high-resolution electron microscopy imaging techniques.},

We show that while it is difficult to identify the intermediates from their infrared and Raman signals, the simulated EVV-2DIR spectra of these intermediates have well resolved spectral features, which are absent in the signals of reactants and products. These characteristic spectral signatures can, therefore, be used to reveal the reaction mechanism as well as monitor the reaction progress.

It is the fluctuations and rearrangements of this network that stabilize reaction products and drive the transport of excess protons through solution. Experimental observations of the dynamics of the hydrogen bonded network are difficult because (1) the timescales are exceedingly fast with relevant fluctuations occurring on a tens of femtosecond period and (2) the experimental probe must be sensitive to the local hydrogen bonded structure. In this thesis I address these experimental challenges through the development of ultrafast nonlinear infrared spectroscopy of the OH stretch of HOD in D20. The frequency of the OH stretch, OH, is sensitive to the configuration of the hydrogen bonded pair. Therefore, time-dependent changes in OoH can be correlated with changes in the hydrogen bonded geometry.},

  abstract = {Characterizing ultrafast energy and charge transfer is important for understanding a wide range of systems, from natural photosynthetic complexes to organic photovoltaics. Distinguishing the kinetic processes of energy transfer and charge separation in such systems is challenging due to the lack of clear spectral signatures of charge transfer states, which are typically nonradiative. Stark spectroscopy has proven to be a valuable method for uncovering charge transfer states. Here we extend the dimensionality of Stark spectroscopy to perform two-dimensional electronic Stark spectroscopy. We demonstrate the method on TIPS-pentacene in 3-methylpentane at 77 K. The additional frequency dimension of two-dimensional Stark spectroscopy promises to enable the identification of charge transfer states, their coupling to other charge transfer and exciton states, and their involvement in charge separation processes.},

Because of their size and sophisticated electronic structures, multiscale methods are required to investigate the dynamical and spectroscopic properties of such complexes. The excitation energies, in this context also known as site energies, excitonic couplings, and spectral densities are key quantities which usually need to be extracted to be able to determine the exciton dynamics and spectroscopic properties. The recently developed multiscale approach based on the numerically efficient density functional tight-binding framework followed by excited state calculations has been shown to be superior to the scheme based on pure classical molecular dynamics simulations. The enhanced approach, which improves the description of the internal vibrational dynamics of the pigment molecules, yields spectral densities in good agreement with the experimental counterparts for various bacterial and plant LH systems. Here, we provide a brief overview of those results and described the theoretical foundation of the multiscale protocol.},

  abstract = {Infrared (IR) probes based on terminally blocked {$\beta$}-isocyanoalanine (AlaNC) and p-isocyanophenylalanine (PheNC) amino acids were synthesized. These isonitrile (NC)-derivatized compounds were extensively characterized by FTIR and femtosecond IR pump-probe spectroscopies, and a direct comparison was made with popularly used nitrile (CN)- and azide (N3)-derivatized analogs. It is shown that the isonitrile stretch frequency exhibits extremely high sensitivity to hydrogen-bonding interactions. In addition, the IR intensity of the isonitrile group is much higher than that of the nitrile group and almost as intense as that of the azido group. Furthermore, its vibrational lifetime is much longer than that of the nitrile and azido groups. To elucidate the origin of such a high H-bond sensitivity and IR intensity observed for isonitrile, extensive quantum chemical calculations were performed. It is shown that the Coulombic contributions to the vibrational frequency shifts of the isonitrile and nitrile stretch modes have opposite signs but similar magnitudes, whereas the contributions of exchange repulsion and charge delocalization to their frequency shifts are comparable. Therefore, the isonitrile stretch frequency is much more sensitive to H-bonding interactions because the blue-shifting exchange-repulsion effects are additionally enforced by such electrostatic effects. It is also shown that the much higher IR intensity of the isonitrile group compared to that of the nitrile group is due to the configuration reversal of the atomic electronegativity between the NC and CN groups. Owing to these features, we believe that isonitrile is a much better IR reporter of H-bonding structure and dynamics than the widely used nitrile and azide.},

Existing rotational motors have two key components: photoisomerization around a {$\pi$}-bond followed by a thermally activated helical inversion, the latter being the rate-determining step. We propose an alternative molecular system in which the rotation is caused by the electric coupling of chromophores. This is used to engineer the excited state energy surface and achieve unidirectional rotation using light as the only input and avoid the slow thermally activated step, potentially leading to much faster operational speeds. To test the working principle, we employ quantum-classical calculations to study the dynamics of such a system. We estimate that motors built on this principle should be able to work on a subnanosecond time scale for such a full rotation. We explore the parameter space of our model to guide the design of a molecule that can act as such a motor.},

  abstract = {Some twelve years ago, Nature published an article reporting an evidence for wavelike energy transfer in the Fenna-Mattews-Olson complex, a small photosynthetic antenna isolated from green bacteria (Engel et al., 2007). In a broader sense, this publication marks a start of a complicated series of events, which constitute a part of what could be called a quantum revolution in biology. In this paper, we revisit the past decade of development in theoretical understanding of excitation energy transfer (EET) in photosynthesis under the influence of the new quantum vision of this field. In order to set the context, we review the status of the quantum theory of EET before the field has become a part of the broader discipline of quantum biology. We rephrase some of its former concepts in terms of decoherence theory and in the language of quasi-particles, to show the place, which theoretical photosynthesis research occupied in the big picture of quantum mechanics, physical chemistry and solid state physics before the supposed quantum revolution. We examine the influence of the new quantum-biological vocabulary, established over past ten years, on the development of the field. While the field has shown steady progress, directly related to the finds of Engel et al., we demonstrate that concepts ill-defined in the context of photosynthesis research, and imported from other branches of physics, actually hinder understanding of important natural photo-physical processes. Without providing suitable equivalent or added value, they threaten to replace concepts, which tie photosynthesis research to the related disciplines of chemistry and solid state physics. We demonstrate these claims by analyzing in some detail several recent paradigmatic papers from high profile journals.},

We present ultrafast anisotropy dynamics, resolved in both time and frequency, of the transmembrane light-harvesting complex LH2 from Rhodobacter sphaeroides in its native membrane environment using polarization-controlled twodimensional electronic spectroscopy. Time-dependent anisotropy obtained from both experiment and modified Redfield simulation reveals an orientational preference for excited state absorption and an ultrafast equilibration within the B850 band in LH2. This ultrafast equilibration is favorable for subsequent energy transfer toward the reaction center. Our results also show a dynamic difference in excited state absorption anisotropy between the directly excited B850 population and the population that is initially excited at 800 nm, suggesting absorption from B850 states to higher-lying excited states following energy transfer from B850*. These results give insight into the ultrafast dynamics of bacterial light harvesting and the excited state energy landscape of LH2 in the native membrane environment.},

  abstract = {An interatomic model potential for molecular dynamics is derived from first-principles and used to study the molecular rotations and relaxation times in methylammonium lead halide, here considered the prototypical example of a hybrid crystal with a strong reorientational dynamics. Within the limits of a simple ionic scheme, the potential is able to catch the main qualitative features of the material at zero and finite temperature and opens the way to the development of classical potentials for hybrid perovskites. In agreement with experiments and previous theoretical findings, the molecule trajectories exhibit a transition from a dynamics dominated by high symmetry directions at low temperature to a fast dynamics at room temperature in which the molecule can reorient quasirandomly. By computing the angular time correlation function we discuss the reorientational time as a function of temperature in comparison with existing literature, providing a simple model and a clear attribution of the relaxation times in terms of their temperature dependence. This work clarifies the temperature dependence of the relaxation times and the interpretation of the experimental data in terms of the different mechanisms contributing to the molecule dynamics.},

It has been tested on systems of millions of particles. Many common file formats of simulation packages including CHARMM, Gromacs, Amber, and NAMD and the Protein Data Bank format can be read and written. Atoms can be selected with a syntax similar to CHARMM's powerful selection commands. MDAnalysis enables both novice and experienced programmers to rapidly write their own analytical tools and access data stored in trajectories in an easily accessible manner that facilitates interactive explorative analysis. MDAnalysis has been tested on and works for most Unix-based platforms such as Linux and Mac OS X. It is freely available under the GNU General Public License from http://mdanalysis.googlecode.com.},

Their efficient energy transfer pathways make them suitable candidates for artificial light harvesting systems. This great potential calls for an indepth spectroscopic analysis of the underlying energy deactivation network and coherence dynamics. We use two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy with sub-10 fs laser pulses in combination with twodimensional decay-associated spectra analysis to describe the population flow within the aggregate. Based on the analysis of Fourier-transform amplitude maps, we distinguish between vibrational or vibronic coherence dynamics as the origin of pronounced oscillations in our two-dimensional electronic spectra.},

  abstract = {The process of photosynthesis is initiated by the capture of sunlight by a network of light-absorbing molecules (chromophores), which are also responsible for the subsequent funneling of the excitation energy to the reaction centers. Through evolution, genetic drift, and speciation, photosynthetic organisms have discovered many solutions for light harvesting. In this review, we describe the underlying photophysical principles by which this energy is absorbed, as well as the mechanisms of electronic excitation energy transfer (EET). First, optical properties of the individual pigment chromophores present in light-harvesting antenna complexes are introduced, and then we examine the collective behavior of pigment-pigment and pigment-protein interactions. The description of energy transfer, in particular multichromophoric antenna structures, is shown to vary depending on the spatial and energetic landscape, which dictates the relative coupling strength between constituent pigment molecules. In the latter half of the article, we focus on the lightharvesting complexes of purple bacteria as a model to illustrate the present understanding of the synergetic effects leading to EET optimization of light-harvesting antenna systems while exploring the structure and function of the integral chromophores. We end this review with a brief overview of the energy-transfer dynamics and pathways in the light-harvesting antennas of various photosynthetic organisms.},

  abstract = {The dynamics of water confined in two different types of reverse micelles are studied using ultrafast infrared pump-probe spectroscopy of the hydroxyl OD stretch of HOD in H2O. Reverse micelles of the surfactant Aerosol-OT (ionic head group) in isooctane and the surfactant Igepal CO 520 (nonionic head group) in 50/50 wt \% cyclohexane/hexane are prepared to have the same diameter water nanopools. Measurements of the IR spectra and vibrational lifetimes show that the identity of the surfactant head groups affects the local environment experienced by the water molecules inside the reverse micelles. The orientational dynamics (time-dependent anisotropy), which is a measure of the hydrogen bond network rearrangement, are very similar for the confined water in the two types of reverse micelles. The results demonstrate that confinement by an interface to form a nanoscopic water pool is a primary factor governing the dynamics of nanoscopic water rather than the presence of charged groups at the interface.},

In room-temperature 2D electronic spectra near the band edge, we observe amplitude oscillations due to a remarkably long lived 0.9 THz coherent phonon population at room temperature. This phonon (or set of phonons) is assigned to angular distortions of the Pb-I lattice, not coupled to cation rotations. The strong coupling between the electronic transition and the 0.9 THz mode(s), together with relative isolation from other phonon modes, makes it likely to cause a phonon bottleneck. The pump frequency resolution of the 2D spectra also enables independent observation of photoinduced absorptions and bleaches independently and confirms that features due to band gap renormalization are longer-lived than in transient absorption spectra.},

  abstract = {Energy transfer processes in photosynthetic light harvesting 2 (LH2) complexes isolated from purple bacterium Rhodopseudomonas palustris grown at different light intensities were studied by ground state and transient absorption spectroscopy. The decomposition of ground state absorption spectra shows contributions from B800 and B850 bacteriochlorophyll (BChl) a rings, the latter component splitting into a low energy and a high energy band in samples grown under low light (LL) conditions. A spectral analysis reveals strong inhomogeneity of the B850 excitons in the LL samples that is well reproduced by an exponential-type distribution. Transient spectra show a bleach of both the low energy and high energy bands, together with the respective blue-shifted exciton-to-biexciton transitions. The different spectral evolutions were analyzed by a global fitting procedure. Energy transfer from B800 to B850 occurs in a mono-exponential process and the rate of this process is only slightly reduced in LL compared to high light samples. In LL samples, spectral relaxation of the B850 exciton follows strongly nonexponential kinetics that can be described by a reduction of the bleach of the high energy excitonic component and a red-shift of the low energetic one. We explain these spectral changes by picosecond exciton relaxation caused by a small coupling parameter of the excitonic splitting of the BChl a molecules to the surrounding bath. The splitting of exciton energy into two excitonic bands in LL complex is most probably caused by heterogenous composition of LH2 apoproteins that gives some of the BChls in the B850 ring B820-like site energies, and causes a disorder in LH2 structure.},

The investigations have been inspired by recent 2D vibrational spectroscopy experiments of Woutersen and Hamm (J. Phys. Chem. B 2000, 104, 11316), who determined the structure and the conformational fluctuations of trialanine. The MD studies include various unbiased 20-ns simulations as well as umbrella sampling calculations of the potential of mean force along the central dihedral angles of trialanine. By employing the GROMOS96 force field, it is predicted that solvated trialanine is predominantly (similar to80\%) found in the extended conformations beta and P-II and is also (similar to16\%) found in the helix conformation alpha(R). The results are explained by analyzing the free-energy contributions of intra- and intermolecular interactions, calculating the absolute entropy of the trialanine molecule, investigating the solvation and hydrogen bonding of the peptide, and studying the transitions between the extended and helix conformations. Moreover, the vibrational cross-relaxation rates associated with the two amide I modes of trialanine are calculated. The conformational structures and dynamics obtained from the MD studies are shown to be in good overall agreement with experimental data.},

Purified monomeric core complexes from Rhodopseudomonas (Rps.) palustris have been used to isolate and identify the putative Protein W. This information was then used to create a Protein W deletion mutant. A low-resolution crystal structure of the monomeric core complex from Allochromatium (Alc.) vinosum is presented which suggests that the LH1 complex is a complete ellipse, unlike the core complex from Rps. palustris.},

The thermodynamic stability of a set of hydrogen-ordered ice II variants relative to ice II is evaluated theoretically. It is found that ice II is more stable than the disordered variants so generated as to satisfy the simple ice rule due to the lower zeropoint energy as well as the pair interaction energy. The residual entropy of the disordered ice II phase gradually compensates the unfavorable free energy with increasing temperature. The crossover, however, occurs at a high temperature well above the melting point of ice III. Consequently, the hydrogen-disordered phase does not exist in nature. The thermodynamic stability of partially hydrogen-disordered ices is also scrutinized by examining the free-energy components of several variants obtained by systematic inversion of OH directions in ice II. The potential energy of one variant is lower than that of the ice II structure, but its Gibbs free energy is slightly higher than that of ice II due to the zero-point energy. The slight difference in the thermodynamic stability leaves the possibility of the partial hydrogen-disorder in real ice II.},

  abstract = {Bryopsis corticulans is a marine green macroalga adapted to the intertidal environment. It possesses siphonaxanthinbinding light-harvesting complexes of photosystem II (LHCII) with spectroscopic properties markedly different from the LHCII in plants. By applying a phenomenological fitting procedure to the two-dimensional electronic spectra of the LHCII from B. corticulans measured at 77 K, we can extract information about the excitonic states and energy-transfer processes. The fitting method results in well-converged parameters, including excitonic energy levels with their respective transition dipole moments, spectral widths, energy-transfer rates, and coupling properties. The 2D spectra simulated from the fitted parameters concur very well with the experimental data, showing the robustness of the fitting method. An excitonic energy-transfer scheme can be constructed from the fitting parameters. It shows the rapid energy transfer from chlorophylls (Chls) b to a at subpicosecond time scales and a long-lived state in the Chl b region at around 659 nm. Three weakly connected terminal states are resolved at 671, 675, and 677 nm. The lowest state is higher in energy than that in plant LHCII, which is probably because of the fewer number of Chls a in a B. corticulans LHCII monomer. Modeling based on existing Hamiltonians for the plant LHCII structure with two Chls a switched to Chls b suggests several possible Chl a-b replacements in comparison with those of plant LHCII. The adaptive changes result in a slower energy equilibration in the complex, revealed by the longer relaxation times of several exciton states compared to those of plant LHCII. The strength of our phenomenological fitting method for obtaining excitonic energy levels and energy-transfer network is put to the test in systems such as B. corticulans LHCII, where prior knowledge on exact assignment and spatial locations of pigments are lacking.},

  abstract = {We present a semiclassical approach for nonadiabatic molecular dynamics based on the Ehrenfest method with corrections for decoherence and detailed balance. Decoherence is described via a coherence penalty functional that drives dynamics away from regions in Hilbert space characterized by large values of coherences. Detailed balance is incorporated by modification of the off-diagonal matrix elements with a quantum correction factor used in semiclassical approximations to quantum time-correlation functions. Both decoherence and detailed balance corrections introduce nonlinear terms to the Schr\"odinger equation. At the same time, the simplicity of fully deterministic dynamics and a single trajectory for each initial condition is preserved. In contrast, surface hopping is stochastic and requires averaging over multiple realization of the stochastic process for each initial condition. The Ehrenfest-decoherence-detailed-balance (Ehrenfest-DDB) method is adapted to the classical path approximation and ab initio time-dependent density functional theory and applied to an experimentally studied nanoscale system consisting of a fluorophore molecule and an scanning tunneling microscopy tip and undergoing current-induced charge injection, cooling, and recombination. Ehrenfest-DDB produces time scales that are similar to those obtained with decoherence induced surface hopping, which is a popular nonadiabatic molecular dynamics technique applied to condensed matter. At long times, Ehrenfest-DDB dynamics slows down considerably because the detailed balance correction makes off-diagonal elements go to zero on approach to Boltzmann equilibrium. The Ehrenfest-DDB technique provides efficient means to study quantum dynamics in large systems.},

  abstract = {Two new light-driven molecular rotary motors based on the N-alkylated indanylidene benzopyrrole frameworks are proposed and studied using quantum chemical calculations and nonadiabatic molecular dynamics simulations. These new motors perform pure axial rotation, and the photochemical steps of the rotary cycle are dominated by the fast bondlength-alternation motion that enables ultrafast access to the S1/S0 intersection. The new motors are predicted to display a quantum efficiency higher than that of the currently available synthetic all-hydrocarbon motors. Remarkably, the quantum efficiency is not governed by the topography (peaked versus sloped) of the minimum-energy conical intersection, whereas the S1 decay time depends on the topography as well as on the energy of the intersection relative to the S1 minimum. It is the axial chirality (helicity), rather than the point chirality, that controls the sense of rotation of the motor.},

  abstract = {The accuracy of approximate methods for calculating linear optical spectra depends on many variables. In this study, we fix most of these parameters to typical values found in photosynthetic light-harvesting complexes of plants and determine the accuracy of approximate spectra with respect to exact calculation as a function of the energy gap and interpigment coupling in a pigment dimer. We use a spectral density with the first eight intramolecular modes of chlorophyll a and include inhomogeneous disorder for the calculation of spectra. We compare the accuracy of absorption, linear dichroism, and circular dichroism spectra calculated using the Full Cumulant Expansion (FCE), coherent time-dependent Redfield (ctR), and time-independent Redfield and modified Redfield methods. As a reference we use spectra calculated with the Exact Stochastic Path Integral Evaluation method. We find the FCE method to be the most accurate for the calculation of all spectra. The ctR method performs well for the qualitative calculation of absorption and linear dichroism spectra when pigments are moderately coupled ({$\sim$}15 cm               -1               ), but ctR spectra may differ significantly from exact spectra when strong interpigment coupling (\&gt;100 cm               -1               ) is present. The dependence of the quality of Redfield and modified Redfield spectra on molecular parameters is similar, and these methods almost always perform worse than ctR, especially when the interpigment coupling is strong or the excitonic energy gap is small (for a given coupling). The accuracy of approximate spectra is not affected by resonance with intramolecular modes for typical system-bath coupling and disorder values found in plant light-harvesting complexes.},

Here we reveal for a synthetic model system based on a zinc chlorin (ZnChl) dye an intriguing interplay of two competing aggregation pathways by kinetic and thermodynamic studies in MeOH/water solvent mixtures: the formation of kinetically controlled off-pathway nanoparticles consisting of excitonically coupled J-dimers               versus               the formation of thermodynamically more stable one-dimensional helical fibers consisting of J-coupled extended aggregates. The higher order of the latter is evidenced by atomic force microscopy and a more narrow absorption spectrum of the J-aggregates. Based on a recently developed thermodynamic model that combines the cooperative               K               2               \textendash{}               K               growth model with a competing dimerization model, an energy landscape could be derived that describes the pathway complexity of this biomimetic system. Our studies reveal that the kinetic stability of the off-pathway nanoparticles increases with increasing concentration of ZnChl or water content in a MeOH/water solvent mixture. For a water content {$>$}90\% deeply trapped off-pathway nanoparticle products are formed that do not transform anymore to the more ordered thermodynamic product within reasonable time scales. Based on these observations, we hypothesize that out-of-equilibrium aggregate structures of natural BChl dyes may also exist in the natural chlorosomes of green bacteria.},

  abstract = {The experimental observation of long-lived quantum coherences in the Fenna\`AMatthews\`AOlson (FMO) light-harvesting complex at low temperatures has challenged general intuition in the field of complex molecular systems and provoked considerable theoretical effort in search of explanations. Here we report on room-temperature calculations of the excited-state dynamics in FMO using a combination of molecular dynamics simulations and electronic structure calculations. Thus we obtain trajectories for the Hamiltonian of this system which contains time-dependent vertical excitation energies of the individual bacteriochlorophyll molecules and their mutual electronic couplings. The distribution of energies and couplings is analyzed together with possible spatial correlations. It is found that in contrast to frequent assumptions the site energy distribution is non-Gaussian. In a subsequent step, averaged wave packet dynamics is used to determine the exciton dynamics in the system. Finally, with the time-dependent Hamiltonian, linear and two-dimensional spectra are determined. The thus-obtained linear absorption line shape agrees well with experimental observation and is largely determined by the non-Gaussian site energy distribution. The two-dimensional spectra are in line with what one would expect by extrapolation of the experimental observations at lower temperatures and indicate almost total loss of long-lived coherences.},

  abstract = {Using an implementation of heterodyne-detected vibrational echo spectroscopy, we show that equilibrium spectral diffusion caused by solvation dynamics can be measured in a fraction of the time required using traditional twodimensional infrared spectroscopy. Spectrally resolved, heterodyne-detected rephasing and nonrephasing signals, recorded at a single delay between the first two pulses in a photon echo sequence, can be used to measure the full waiting time dependent spectral dynamics that are typically extracted from a series of 2D-IR spectra. Hence, data acquisition is accelerated by more than 1 order of magnitude, while permitting extremely fine sampling of the spectral dynamics during the waiting time between the second and third pulses. Using cymantrene (cyclopentadienyl manganese tricarbonyl, CpMn(CO)3) in alcohol solutions, we compare this novel approachdenoted rapidly acquired spectral diffusion (RASD)with a traditional method using full 2D-IR spectra, finding excellent agreement. Though this approach is largely limited to isolated vibrational bands, we also show how to remove interference from cross-peaks that can produce characteristic modulations of the spectral dynamics through vibrational quantum beats.},

  abstract = {Interest in layered organohalide perovskites is motivated by their potential for use in optoelectronic devices. In these systems, the smallest and largest quantum wells are primarily concentrated near the glass and air interfaces of a film, thereby establishing a gradient in the average values of the bandgaps. It has been suggested that this layered architecture promotes the funneling of electronic excitations through space in a manner similar to light-harvesting processes in photosynthetic antennae. Whereas energy and charge transfer are difficult to distinguish by conventional transient absorption techniques, it has recently been shown that these competing relaxation mechanisms may be separately targeted with nonlinear fluorescence (NLFL) and photocurrent ``action spectroscopies.'' Here, we present perturbative rate functions to describe NLFL experiments conducted on layered perovskite systems. The formulas reproduce the patterns of resonances observed in experimental measurements and show how signatures of energy transfer manifest in two-dimensional spectra. Overall, this work suggests that NLFL spectroscopy may be used to fully reveal the trajectories of electronic excitations by correlating ultrafast energy transfer pathways to fluorescence emission from the thickest quantum wells.},

Through temperature-dependent heterodyne optical Kerr effect studies, an upper limit (150 +/- 30 fs extrapolated to 100 degrees C) for the homogeneous lifetime in liquid water was established. The intermediate fifth-order case was analyzed to incorporate this dynamically evolving distribution of local environments and indicates that, even for a system as complex as water, higher-order field correlations can access information on its dynamic structure.},

The model is developed generally, and calculations are applied specifically to temperature-dependent OHD-RIKE measurements of liquid water. The results indicate that the line broadening in the low-frequency vibrational distribution due to the hydrogen-bonded network structure of liquid water is mostly inhomogeneous, with an effective homogeneous relaxation time of 350 fs at 24 degrees C.},

We observe evidence of a low-frequency vibrational mode at 315 cm-1, which transfers excitons from the outer wall of the nanotubes to a crossing point through which energy transfer to the inner wall can occur. This mode is furthermore absent in solution phase. Importantly, the coherence of this mode is not transferred to the inner wall upon energy transfer and is only present on the outer wall's excited-state energy surface, highlighting that complete energy transfer between the outer and inner walls does not take place. Isolation of the individual walls of the nanotubes provides evidence that this mode corresponds to a supramolecular motion of the nanotubes. Our results emphasize the importance of the solid-state environment in modulating vibronic coupling and directing energy transfer in molecular light-harvesting systems.},

  abstract = {We present two-dimensional infrared (2D IR) spectra of the OD stretch vibration of isotope diluted water (HOD/H2O) from ambient conditions (293 K) down to the metastable supercooled regime (260 K). We observe that spectral diffusion slows down from 700 fs to 2.6 ps as we lower the temperature. A comparison between measurements performed at the magic angle with those at parallel polarization shows that the 2D IR line shape is affected by the frequencydependent anisotropy decay in the case of parallel polarization, altering the extracted correlation decay. A fit within the framework of an Arrhenius law reveals an activation energy of Ea = 6.2 ( 0.2 kcal/mol and a pre-exponential factor of 1/A = 0.02 ( 0.01 fs. Alternatively, a power law fit results in an exponent {$\gamma$} = 2.2 and a singularity temperature Ts = 221 K. We tentatively conclude that the power law provides the better physical picture to describe the dynamics of liquid water around the freezing point.

  abstract = {Whereas surface hopping is usually used to study populations and mean-field dynamics to study coherences, in two recent papers, we described a procedure for calculating dipole-dipole correlation functions (and therefore absorption spectra) directly from ensembles of surface hopping trajectories. We previously applied this method to a handful of one-dimensional model problems intended to mimic the gas phase. In this article, we now benchmark this new procedure on a set of multidimensional model problems intended to mimic the condensed phase and compare our results against other standard semiclassical methods. By comparison, we demonstrate that methods that include only dynamical information from one PES (the standard Kubo approaches) exhibit large discrepancies with the results of exact quantum dynamics. Furthermore, for model problems with nonadiabatic excited state dynamics but no quantized vibrational structure in the spectra, our surface hopping approach performs comparably to using Ehrenfest dynamics to calculate the electronic coherences. That being said, however, when quantized vibrational structures are present in the spectra but the electronic states are uncoupled, performing the dynamics on the mean PES still outperforms our present method. These benchmark results should influence future studies that use ensembles of independent semiclassical trajectories to model linear as well as multidimensional spectra in the condensed phase.},

  abstract = {The genomes of some purple photosynthetic bacteria contain a multigene               puc               family encoding a series of {$\alpha$}- and {$\beta$}-polypeptides that together form a heterogeneous antenna of light-harvesting 2 (LH2) complexes. To unravel this complexity, we generated four sets of               puc               deletion mutants in               Rhodopseudomonas palustris               , each encoding a single type of               pucBA               gene pair and enabling the purification of complexes designated as PucA-LH2, PucB-LH2, PucD-LH2, and PucE-LH2. The structures of all four purified LH2 complexes were determined by cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) at resolutions ranging from 2.7 to 3.6 \AA. Uniquely, each of these complexes contains a hitherto unknown polypeptide, {$\gamma$}, that forms an extended undulating ribbon that lies in the plane of the membrane and that encloses six of the nine LH2 {$\alpha\beta$}-subunits. The {$\gamma$}-subunit, which is located near to the cytoplasmic side of the complex, breaks the C9 symmetry of the LH2 complex and binds six extra bacteriochlorophylls (BChls) that enhance the 800-nm absorption of each complex. The structures show that all four complexes have two complete rings of BChls, conferring absorption bands centered at 800 and 850 nm on the PucA-LH2, PucB-LH2, and PucE-LH2 complexes, but, unusually, the PucD-LH2 antenna has only a single strong near-infared (NIR) absorption peak at 803 nm. Comparison of the cryo-EM structures of these LH2 complexes reveals altered patterns of hydrogen bonds between LH2 {$\alpha\beta$}-side chains and the bacteriochlorin rings, further emphasizing the major role that H bonds play in spectral tuning of bacterial antenna complexes.},

The measured spectrum assignment is assisted by DFT simulations of the Raman spectra of suitable periodic and model systems. The bands at 62 and 94 cm-1 are assigned respectively to the bending and to the stretching of the Pb-I bonds, and are thus diagnostic modes of the inorganic cage. We also assign the librations of the organic cations at 119 and 154 cm-1. The broad, unstructured 200-400 cm-1 features are assigned to the torsional mode of the methylammonium cations, which we propose as a marker of the orientational disorder of the material. Our study provides the basis to interpret the Raman spectra of organohalide perovskites, which may allow one to further understand the properties of this important class of materials in relation to their full exploitation in solar cells.},

  abstract = {Multi-dimensional spectroscopy represents a particularly insightful tool for investigating the interplay of nuclear and electronic dynamics, which plays an important role in a number of photophysical processes and photochemical reactions. Here, we present a coherent state representation of the vibronic dynamics and of the resulting response functions for the widely used linearly displaced harmonic oscillator model. Analytical expressions are initially derived for the case of third-order response functions in an N-level system, with ground state initialization of the oscillator (zero-temperature limit). The results are then generalized to the case of Mth order response functions, with arbitrary M. The formal derivation is translated into a simple recipe, whereby the explicit analytical expressions of the response functions can be derived directly from the Feynman diagrams. We further generalize to the whole set of initial coherent states, which form an overcomplete basis. This allows one, in principle, to derive the dependence of the response functions on arbitrary initial states of the vibrational modes and is here applied to the case of thermal states. Finally, a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian approach is used to include in the above expressions the effect of vibrational relaxation.},

The complex is a part of the light-harvesting system of green photosynthetic bacteria. Its lowest-energy absorption band, peaking at 826 nm and responsible for the fluorescence, is believed to be due to Qy transitions of largely isolated molecules. One of the main merits of the used method compared with the more common fluorescence line narrowing is that the zero-phonon lines (ZPL) resonant with the excitation laser can be accurately measured, allowing precise determination of the Huang\textendash Rhys (HR) factors, the main characteristics of the linear electron\textendash phonon and vibronic coupling strengths. Over 60 individual vibrational modes of intra- and intermolecular origin have been resolved in the energy range of 45\textendash 1600 cm\`A1. The small HR factors for these modes, ranging between 0.001 and 0.018, add up to a value of Svib {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0.3870.07. The effective HR factor for the phonons, Sph, was found clearly wavelengthdependent, varying from \$0.7 at short wavelengths to \$0.3 at the long-wavelength tail of the absorption spectrum. Coupling between the BChl a molecules is likely responsible for this wavelength dependence.},

Here, we investigate the excited state de-excitation dynamics and exciton diffusion in TPA-T-DCV-Ph-F small molecule, having simple chemical structure with asymmetrical architecture and end-capped with electron-withdrawing               p               -fluorodicyanovinyl group. The excited state lifetime in diluted solutions (0.04~ns in toluene and 0.4~ns in chloroform) are found to be surprisingly shorter compared to the solid state (3~ns in PMMA matrix). Time-dependent density functional theory indicates that this behavior originates from non-radiative relaxation of the excited state through a conical intersection between the ground and singlet excited state potential energy surfaces. Exciton diffusion length of\,\textasciitilde\,16~nm in solution processed films was retrieved by employing time-resolved photoluminescence volume quenching measurements with Monte Carlo simulations. As means of investigating the device performance of TPA-T-DCV-Ph-F, we manufactured solution and vacuum processed bulk heterojunction solar cells that yielded efficiencies of\,\textasciitilde\,1.5\% and\,\textasciitilde\,3.7\%, respectively. Our findings demonstrate that the short lifetime in solutions does not hinder per se long exciton diffusion length in films thereby granting applications of TPA-T-DCV-Ph-F and similar push\textendash pull molecules in vacuum and solution processable devices.},

  abstract = {Photosynthetic light-harvesting proceeds by the collection and highly efficient transfer of energy through a network of pigment-protein complexes. Interchromophore electronic couplings and interactions between pigments and the surrounding protein determine energy levels of excitonic states, and dictate the mechanism of energy flow. The excitonic structure (orientation of excitonic transition dipoles) of pigment-protein complexes is generally deduced indirectly from x-ray crystallography, in combination with predictions of transition energies and couplings in the chromophore site basis. We demonstrate that coarsegrained, excitonic, structural information in the form of projection angles between transition dipole moments can be obtained from the polarization-dependent, two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy of an isotropic sample, particularly when the nonrephasing or free polarization decay signal, rather than the photon echo signal, is considered. This method provides an experimental link between atomic and electronic structure, and accesses dynamical information with femtosecond time resolution. In an investigation of the Fenna-Matthews-Olson complex from green sulfur bacteria, the energy transfer connecting two particular exciton states in the protein was isolated as the primary contributor to a crosspeak in the nonrephasing two-dimensional spectrum at 400 femtoseconds under a specific sequence of polarized excitation pulses. The results suggest the possibility of designing experiments using combinations of tailored polarization sequences to separate and monitor individual relaxation pathways.},

  abstract = {Two-dimensional infrared spectroscopy of amide I vibrations is increasingly being used to study the structure and dynamics of proteins and peptides. Amide I, a primarily carbonyl stretching vibration of the protein backbone, provides information on secondary structures as a result of vibrational couplings and on hydrogen-bonding contacts when isotope labeling is used to isolate specific sites. In parallel with experiments, computational models of amide I spectra that use atomistic structures from molecular dynamics simulations have evolved to calculate experimental spectra. Mixed quantumclassical models use spectroscopic maps to translate the structural information into a quantum-mechanical Hamiltonian for the spectroscopically observed vibrations. This allows one to model the spectroscopy of large proteins, disordered states, and protein conformational dynamics. With improvements in amide I models, quantitative modeling of time-dependent structural ensembles and of direct feedback between experiments and simulations is possible. We review the advances in developing these models, their theoretical basis, and current and future applications.},

Simulations of broadband 2D spectra provide a useful picture of the overall detectable 2D signals from the nearinfrared (NIR) to the near-ultraviolet (UV). Evolution of the stimulated emission (SE) and excited state absorption (ESA) 2D signals indicates that the S1 \textrightarrow{} SN (with N {$\geq$} 2) ESAs feature a substantial blue-shift only after bond inversion and partial rotation along the cis \textrightarrow{} trans isomerization angle, while the SE rapidly red-shifts during the photoinduced skeletal relaxation of the polyene chain. Different combinations of pulse frequencies are proposed in order to follow the evolution of specific ESA signals. These include a twocolor 2DVis/NIR setup especially suited for tracking the evolution of the S1 \textrightarrow{} S2 transitions that can be used to discriminate between different photochemical mechanisms of retinal photoisomerization as a function of the environment. The reported results are consistent with the available time-resolved pump-probe experimental data, and may be used for the design of more elaborate transient 2D electronic spectroscopy techniques.},

Pulse shaping offers several advantages including rapid data collection, inherent phase stability, and phase-cycling capabilities. Visible array detection via upconversion allows the use of visible detectors that are cheaper, faster, more sensitive, and less noisy than IR detectors. However, despite these advantages, many researchers are reluctant to implement these technologies. Here we present a quantitative study of the S/N of 2D IR spectra collected with a traditional fourwave mixing (FWM) apparatus, with a pulse shaping apparatus, and with visible detection via upconversion to address the question of whether weak chromophores at low concentrations are still accessible with such an apparatus. We find that the enhanced averaging capability of the pulse shaping apparatus enables the detection of small signals that would be challenging to measure even with the traditional FWM apparatus, and we demonstrate this ability on a sample of cyanylated dihydrofolate reductase.},

  abstract = {Vibrational sum-frequency generation (VSFG) spectra of the amide-I band of proteins can give detailed insight into biomolecular processes near membranes. However, interpreting these spectra in terms of the conformation and orientation of a protein can be difficult, especially in the case of complex proteins. Here we present a formalism to calculate the amide-I infrared (IR), Raman, and VSFG spectra based on the protein conformation and orientation distribution. Based on the protein conformation, we set up the amide-I exciton Hamiltonian for the backbone amide modes that generate the linear and nonlinear spectroscopic responses. In this Hamiltonian, we distinguish between nearest-neighbor and non-nearest-neighbor vibrational couplings. To determine nearestneighbor couplings we use an ab initio 6-31G+(d) B3LYP-calculated map of the coupling as a function of the dihedral angles. The other couplings are estimated using the transition-dipole coupling model. The local-mode frequencies of hydrogen-bonded peptide bonds and of peptide bonds to proline residues are red-shifted. To obtain realistic hydrogen-bond shifts we perform a molecular dynamics simulation in which the protein is solvated by water. As a first application, we measure and calculate the amide-I IR, Raman, and VSFG spectra of cholera toxin B subunit docked to a model cell membrane. To deduce the orientation of the protein with respect to the membrane from the VSFG spectra, we compare the experimental and calculated spectral shapes of single-polarization results, rather than comparing the relative amplitudes of VSFG spectra recorded for different polarization conditions for infrared, visible, and sum-frequency light. We find that the intrinsic uncertainty in the interfacial refractive indexessential to determine the overall amplitude of the VSFG spectraprohibits a meaningful comparison of the intensities of the different polarization combinations. In contrast, the spectral shape of most of the VSFG spectra is independent of the details of the interfacial refractive index and provides a reliable way of determining molecular interfacial orientation. Specifically, we find that the symmetry axis of the cholera toxin B subunit is oriented at an angle of 6\textdegree{} {$\pm$} 17\textdegree{} relative to the surface normal of the lipid monolayer, in agreement with 5-fold binding between the toxin's five subunits and the receptor lipids in the membrane.},

In vertical and horizontal PFM imaging, we find domains of alternating polarization with a width of 90 nm which we identify as polarized ferroelectric domains. High-resolution photo-conductive atomic force micrographs under illumination also show alternating charge carrier extraction patterns which we attribute to the local vertical polarization components within the ferroelectric domains. The correlation of the sample properties with atomic force and kelvin probe force micrographs evidence the ferroelectric nature of the domains.},

  abstract = {We investigate how accurate different methods of the spectral line shape analysis work in two-dimensional correlation spectroscopy (2D CS) for systems with non-Gaussian dynamics. A direct link is established between the frequency dependent correlation functions and a number of line shape metrics. Two model systems are constructed mimicking a typical molecular system with conventional Gaussian and non-Gaussian spectral dynamics. The frequency dependent correlation function and several line shape parameters extracted from the 2D CS spectra at different waiting times reveal dissimilar dynamics in different frequency domains in the non-Gaussian case and similar dynamics in all domains in the Gaussian case. The extracted frequency dependent correlation times agree well with the local dynamics in the underlying model for all analysis methods. We also find an extension of the existing line shape analysis methods that allows the extraction of the third-order correlation function.},

  abstract = {Retinal cis-trans isomerization and early relaxation steps have been studied in a 10-ns molecular dynamics simulation of a fully hydrated model of membrane-embedded rhodopsin. The isomerization, induced by transiently switching the potential energy function governing the C11AC12 dihedral angle of retinal, completes within 150 fs and yields a strongly distorted retinal. The most significant conformational changes in the binding pocket are straightening of retinal's polyene chain and separation of its NL-ionone ring from Trp-265. In the following 500 ps, transition of 6s-cis to 6s-trans retinal and dramatic changes in the hydrogen bonding network of the binding pocket involving the counterion for the protonated Schiff base, Glu-113, occur. Furthermore, the energy initially stored internally in the distorted retinal is transformed into nonbonding interactions of retinal with its environment. During the following 10 ns, increased mobilities of some parts of the protein, such as the kinked regions of the helices, mainly helix VI, and the intracellular loop I2, were observed, as well as transient structural changes involving the conserved salt bridge between Glu-134 and Arg-135. These features prepare the protein for major structural transformations achieved later in the photocycle. Retinal's motion, in particular, can be compared to an opening turnstile freeing the way for the proposed rotation of helix VI. This was demonstrated by a steered molecular dynamics simulation in which an applied torque enforced the rotation of helix VI.},

Recent experimental studies of one-dimensional heterotriangulene supramolecular aggregates suggested that singlet excitons in these structures can propagate on several micron distances. We explore this possibility theoretically by combining electronic structure calculations with microscopic models for exciton transport. A detailed characterization of the structural disorder and exciton decoherence is provided. We argue that advanced, well-established exciton transport models, used in our study, give about one order of magnitude shorter estimates for the exciton propagation length which suggest that there are other possible explanations of the experimental results.},

Here, the capability of the label is investigated to query whether or not a ligand is bound to the active site of lysozyme and how the spectroscopy and dynamics change upon ligand binding. The results demonstrate specific differences for center frequencies of the asymmetric azide stretch vibration, the longtime decay, and the static offset of the frequency fluctuation correlation function (FFCF)\textemdash all of which are experimental observables\textemdash between the ligand-free and the ligand-bound N               3               -labeled protein. The center-frequency shifts range from 1 to 8 cm               -1               , which is detectable from state-of-the art experiments. Similarly, the nonvanishing static component {$\Delta$}               0               of the FFCF between ligand-free and ligand-bound protein can differ by up to a factor of 2.5. This makes the azide label a versatile and structurally sensitive probe to report on the dynamics of proteins in a variety of environments and for a range of different applications. Ligand-induced differences in the dynamics are also mapped onto changes in the local and through-space coupling between residues by virtue of dynamical cross correlation maps. This demonstrates that the position where the label is placed also influences the local and global protein motions.},

  abstract = {The quality of molecular dynamics simulations strongly depends on the accuracy of the underlying force fields (FFs) that determine all intra- and intermolecular interactions of the system. Commonly, transferable FF parameters are determined based on a representative set of small molecules. However, such an approach sacrifices accuracy in favor of generality. In this work, an open-source and automated toolkit named Q-Force is presented, which augments these transferable FFs with molecule-specific bonded parameters and atomic charges that are derived from quantum mechanical (QM) calculations. The molecular fragmentation procedure allows treatment of large molecules ({$>$}200 atoms) with a low computational cost. The generated Q-Force FFs can be used at the same computational cost as transferable FFs, but with improved accuracy: We demonstrate this for the vibrational properties on a set of small molecules and for the potential energy surface on a complex molecule (186 atoms) with photovoltaic applications. Overall, the accuracy, user-friendliness, and minimal computational overhead of the Q-Force protocol make it widely applicable for atomistic molecular dynamics simulations.},

  abstract = {Characteristic times of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have been measured by different techniques: transient photovoltage decay, transient photoluminescence, and impedance spectroscopy. A slow dynamic process is detected that shows characteristic times in the seconds to milliseconds scale, with good quantitative agreement between transient photovoltage decay and impedance spectroscopy. Here, we show that this characteristic time is related with a novel slow dynamic process caused by the peculiar structural properties of lead halide perovskites and depending on perovskite crystal size and organic cation nature. This new process may lie at the basis of the current-voltage hysteresis reported for PSCs and could have important implications in PSC performance because it may give rise to distinct dynamical behavior with respect to other classes of photovoltaic devices. Furthermore, we show that low-frequency characteristic time, commonly associated with electronic carrier lifetime in other photovoltaic devices, cannot be attributed to a recombination process in the case of PSCs.},

The implication for the interpretation of previous experiments on different systems and the potential use of this feature are discussed. In particular, we foresee that this kind of feature will be useful for identifying mixed degenerate states and for identifying the origin of symmetry breaking disorder in systems like LH2. Furthermore, this may help identify both vibrational and electronic states in biological systems such as proteins and solid-state materials such as hybrid perovskites.},

Our structure-based model calculations of the distinctive optical properties (absorption, CD, polarization) of LH2 in the near-infrared region use a point-monopole approximation to represent the BChl Q, transition moment. The results of the calculations support the assignment of the ring of 18 closely coupled BChl to B850 (BChl absorbing a t 850 nm) and the larger diameter, parallel ring of 9 weakly coupled BChl to BSOO. All of the significantly allowed transitions in the near infrared are calculated to be perpendicular to the C9 symmetry axis, in agreement with polarization studies of this membrane-associated complex. To match the absorption maxima of the B800 and B850 components using a relative permittivity (dielectric constant) of 2.1, we assign different site energies (12500 and 12260 cm-', respectively) for the Q, transitions of the respective BChl in their protein binding sites. Excitonic coupling is particularly strong among the set of B850 chromophores, with pairwise interaction energies nearly 300 cm-' between nearest neighbors, comparable with the experimental absorption bandwidths at room temperature. These strong interactions, for the full set of 18 B850 chromophores, result in an excitonic manifold that is 1200 cm-I wide. Some of the upper excitonic states should result in weak absorption and perhaps stronger CD features. These predictions from the calculations await experimental verification.},

  abstract = {Two independent pump-probe techniques were used to study the antenna energy transfer kinetics of intact chlorosomes from the green sulfur bacterium Chlorobium tepidum with femtosecond resolution. The isotropic kinetics revealed by one-color experiments in the BChl c antenna were inhomogeneous with respect to wavelength. Multiexponential analyses of the photobleaching/stimulated emission (PB/SE) decay profiles typically yielded (apart from a = 10 fs component that may stem from the initial coherent oscillation) components with lifetimes 1-2 ps and several tens of ps. The largest amplitudes for the latter component occur at 810 nm, the longest wavelength studied. Analyses of most two-color pump-probe profiles with the probe wavelength red-shifted from the pump wavelength yielded no PB/SE rise components. P B / S E components with = 1 ps risetime were found in 790 \textasciitilde{} 810 and 790 \textasciitilde{} 820 nm profiles, in which the probe wavelength is situated well into the BChl a absorption region. A 760 \textasciitilde{} 740 nm uphill two-color experiment yielded a PB/SE component with 4-6 ps risetime. Broadband absorption difference spectra of chlorosomes excited at 720 nm (in the blue edge of the 746 nm BChl c Qy band) exhibit = 15 nm red-shifting of the P B / S E peak wavelength during the first several hundred fs. Analogous spectra excited at 760 nm (at the red edge) show little dynamic spectral shifting. Our results suggest that inhomogeneous broadening and spectral equilibration play a larger role in the early BChl c antenna kinetics in chlorosomes from C. tepidum than in those from C. aurantiacus, a system studied previously. As in C. aurantiacus, the initial one-color anisotropies r(0) for most BChl c wavelengths are close to 0.4. The corresponding residual anisotropies r(\textasciitilde c) are typically 0.19-0.25, which is much lower than found in C. aurantiacus ( {$>$} 0 . 3 5 ) ; the transition moment organization is appreciably less collinear in the BChl c antenna of C. tepidum. However, the final one-color anisotropies at 789 and 801 nm are = 0 and 0.09 respectively, and the final anisotropy in the 780 \textasciitilde{} 800 nm experiment is = - 0 . 1 . These facts indicate that the BChl a transition moments themselves exhibit some order, and are directed at an angle {$>$} 54.7 \textdegree{} on the average from the BChl c moments. The one-color profiles exhibit coherent oscillations at most wavelengths, including 800 nm; Fourier analyses of these oscillations frequently yield components with frequencies 70-80 and 130-140 cm-i.},

Using ultra-broadband and highly time-resolved optical spectroscopy, we follow the evolution of vibrational wavepackets after passage through a conical intersection during the primary visual event, the 11-cis to all-trans photoisomerization of the retinal chromophore in rhodopsin. Comparison of nuclear coherences generated under resonant and off-resonant impulsive excitation conclusively reveals coherent wavepacket motion in the bathorhodopsin photoproduct over the full vibrational manifold. We observe strongly enhanced coherences in low-frequency torsional degrees of freedom over the fingerprint region and almost complete suppression of some hydrogen wagging motion. Our ability to monitor the multidimensional evolution of nuclear wavepackets across multiple electronic states is a general means for studying the structural and dynamic origins of efficient photochemistry and provides critical experimental information for theoretical studies.},

The rate is expressed in terms of the overlap integral between donor fluorescence and acceptor absorption spectra. Typical time scales for systems like photosynthetic antennae are on the order of a few picoseconds. Prior to transfer it is assumed that the initially excited donor molecule has equilibrated with respect to the local environment. However, upon excitation and during the equilibration phase the state of the system needs to be described by the full density matrix, including coherences between donor and acceptor states. While being intuitively clear, addressing this regime experimentally has been a challenge until the recently reported advances in Fluorescence Detected Two-Dimensional Spectroscopy (FD2DS). Here, we demonstrate using fourth order perturbation theory, the conditions for the presence of donor-acceptor coherence induced cross-peaks at zero waiting time between the first and the second pair of pulses. The approach is illustrated for a heterodimer model which facilitates an analytical solution.},

Over the last 20 years, however, alternative functions of this very versatile protein have become the focus of research interests. Upon binding to anionic lipids such as cardiolipin, the protein acquires peroxidase activity. Multiple lines of evidence suggest that this requires a conformational change of the protein which involves partial unfolding of its tertiary structure. This review summarizes the current state of knowledge of how cytochrome c interacts with cardiolipin-containing surfaces and how this affects its structure and function. In this context, we delineate partially conflicting results regarding the affinity of cytochrome c binding to cardiolipin-containing liposomes of different size and its influence on the structure of the protein and the morphology of the membrane.},

These inter-band coupling terms are, however, of the same magnitude as the intra-band coupling between singly excited states. We systematically derive the Frenkel exciton model from quantum chemical considerations, and identify it as a variant of the configuration interaction method. We discuss all non-negligible couplings between collective aggregate states, and provide compact formulae for their calculation. We calculate absorption spectra of molecular aggregate of carotenoids and identify significant band shifts as a result of inter-band coupling. The presence of inter-band coupling terms requires renormalization of the system-bath coupling with respect to standard formulation but renormalization effects are found to be weak. We present detailed discussion of molecular dimer and calculate its time-resolved two-dimensional Fourier transformed spectra to find weak but noticeable effects of peak amplitude redistribution due to inter-band coupling.},

  abstract = {Three-dimensional lead-halide perovskites have attracted a lot of attention due to their ability to combine solution processing with outstanding optoelectronic properties. Despite their soft ionic nature these materials demonstrate a surprisingly low level of electronic disorder resulting in sharp band edges and narrow distributions of the electronic energies. Understanding how structural and dynamic disorder impacts the optoelectronic properties of these perovskites is important for many applications. Here we combine ultrafast two-dimensional vibrational spectroscopy and molecular dynamics simulations to study the dynamics of the organic methylammonium (MA) cation orientation in a range of pure and mixed trihalide perovskite materials. For pure MAPbX3 (X = I, Br, Cl) perovskite films, we observe that the cation dynamics accelerate with decreasing size of the halide atom. This acceleration is surprising given the expected strengthening of the hydrogen bonds between the MA and the smaller halide anions, but can be explained by the increase in the polarizability with the size of halide. Much slower dynamics, up to partial immobilization of the organic cation, are observed in the mixed MAPb(ClxBr1-x)3 and MAPb(BrxI1-x)3 alloys, which we associate with symmetry breaking within the perovskite unit cell. The observed dynamics are essential for understanding the effects of structural and dynamical disorder in perovskite-based optoelectronic systems.},

Recently, it was suggested that this high performance originates from the presence of ferroelectricity in the perovskite, which is hypothesized to lower charge recombination in the device. Here, we investigate and quantify the influence of mesoscale ferroelectric polarization on the device performance of perovskite solar cells. We implement a 3D drift diffusion model to describe the solar cell operation. To account for the mesoscale ferroelectricity, we incorporate domains defined by polarization strength,               P               , in 3D space, forming different polarization landscapes or microstructures. Study of microstructures with highly-ordered polarized domains shows that charge transport and recombination in the solar cell depends significantly on the polarization landscape               viz.               the orientation of domain boundaries and the size of domains. In the case of the microstructure with random correlated polarization, a realistic scenario, we find indication of the existence of channels for efficient charge transport in the device which leads to lowering of charge recombination, as evidenced by the high fill factor (FF). However, the high open-circuit voltage (               V               OC               ), which is typical of high performance perovskite solar cells, is unlikely to be explained by the presence of ferroelectric polarization in the perovskite.},

Here, we employ our theoretical mixed quantum/ classical approach to investigate these differences. We find reasonable agreement between calculated and experimental line shapes at both high and low temperatures. From understanding the structure of ice Ih and its vibrational exciton Hamiltonian, we provide assignments of the IR and Raman spectral features for both H2O and D2O ice Ih. We find that in H2O ice these features are due to strong and weak intermolecular coupling, not to intramolecular coupling. The differences between H2O and D2O ice spectra are attributed to the significantly stronger intramolecular coupling in D2O ice. Our conclusion for both H2O and D2O ice is that the molecular symmetric and antisymmetric normal modes do not form a useful basis for understanding OH or OD stretch spectroscopy.},

  abstract = {It is well-known that in ice Ih the oxygen atoms form a regular hexagonal lattice while the positions of the hydrogen atoms are disordered, called proton disorder in the literature. Various OH (OD) stretch vibrational spectroscopies (e.g., IR, Raman, two-dimensional IR (2DIR), and hole burning) have been used to probe this proton disorder in the past several decades. However, the presence and the magnitude of the inhomogeneous broadening due to this proton disorder in the vibrational spectroscopy is still controversial. In this work, we calculate 2DIR spectroscopy for HOD in D2O ice Ih at 80 K with a mixed quantum/classical approach, and make comparison to a recent 2DIR experiment on the same system. Fair agreement is achieved between theory and experiment, although the calculated 2DIR line shape shows inhomogeneous broadening that was not observed in the experiment. However, the theory reproduces the linear IR for the same system fairly well, and the inhomogeneous broadening from the calculation is consistent with the extrapolation of the experimental IR line-widths in the literature. The effect of this proton disorder on the 2DIR line shape is explored in detail. We also calculate the vibrational three-pulse photon echo peak shift signal, which shows signatures of both low-frequency dynamics and inhomogeneous broadening.},

Recent two-dimensional infrared spectroscopic measurements provided new data. The spectra are, however, challenging to interpret and here we provide simulations that help overcome experimental issues as thermal signals and finite pulse duration.

The overall dynamics is demonstrated to be faster than observed for the corresponding liquid water. We find that excitonic cross peaks exist between the dominant exciton peaks. This leads us to conclude that the cross peaks arise due to the formation of delocalized exciton states, which have essentially no directional correlation between their transition dipoles as opposed to what is commonly seen, for example, in isolated water, where the transition dipoles of the eigenstates are perpendicular to each other.},

  abstract = {Excitonic interaction between pigment molecules is largely responsible for the static and dynamic spectroscopic properties of photosynthetic pigment-proteins. This paper provides a new description of its effect on polarized absorption spectroscopy, in particular on circular dichroism (CD). We investigate excitonic spectra of finite width and use "spectral moments" to compare 1) inhomogeneously broadened excitonic spectra, 2) spectra that are (homogeneously) broadened by vibrations or electron-phonon interaction, and 3) spectra that are simulated by applying convolution after the interaction has been evaluated. Two cases are distinguished. If the excitonic splitting is smaller than the width of the interacting absorption bands, the broadening of the excitonic spectrum can be approximated by a convolution approach, although a correction is necessary for CD spectra. If the excitonic splitting exceeds the bandwidth, the well-known exchange narrowing occurs. We demonstrate that this is accompanied by redistribution of dipole strength and spectral shifts. The magnitude of a CD spectrum is conveniently expressed by its first spectral moment. As will be shown, this is independent of spectral broadening as well as dispersive shifts induced by pigment-protein interactions. Consequently, it provides a simple tool to relate the experimental CD spectrum of a pigment complex to the excitonic interactions from which it originates. To illustrate the potential of the presented framework, the spectroscopy of the LH2 pigment-protein complex from purple bacteria is analyzed and compared for dimer-like and ring-like structures. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that the variability of the CD of chlorosomes from green bacteria can be explained by small changes in the structure of their cylindrical bacteriochlorophyll c subunits.},

  abstract = {Phototropins, a class of light-activated protein kinases, are essential for several blue light responses in plants and algae, including phototropism. These proteins contain two internal light, oxygen, and voltage sensitive (LOV) domains, which bind flavin chromophores and undergo a reversible photochemical formation of a cysteinyl-flavin adduct as part of the light sensing process. While the photodynamic properties of such photosensory domains are dictated by interactions between the chromophore and surrounding protein, more distant residues can play a significant role as well. Here we explore the role of the Phe434 residue in the photosensory response of the second LOV domain of Avena sativa phototropin 1 (AsLOV2), a model photochemical system for these LOV domains. Phe434 is more than 6 \AA{} from the FMN chromophore in AsLOV2; nevertheless, an F434Y point mutation is likely to change several structural features of the chromophore binding site, as we demonstrate using molecular dynamics simulations. Transient absorption signals spanning 15 decades in time were compared for wild-type AsLOV2 and the F434Y mutant, showing that the latter has significantly altered photodynamics, including (i) a faster intersystem crossing leading to triplet formation on a nanosecond time scale, (ii) biphasic formation of adduct-state kinetics on the microsecond time scale, and (iii) greatly accelerated ground-state recovery kinetics on a second time scale. We present mechanistic models that link these spectroscopic differences to changes in the configuration of the critical cysteine residue and in the chromophore's accessibility to solvent and oxygen according to MD trajectories and purging experiments. Taken together, these results demonstrate the importance of residues outside the chromophore-binding pocket in modulating LOV domain photodynamics.},

  abstract = {The origin of quantum coherence in two-dimensional (2D) electronic spectra of molecular aggregates and light-harvesting complexes still remains an open question. In particular, it could be challenging to distinguish between electronic and vibrational coherences for a coupled system, where both degrees of freedom can be simultaneously excited. In this Letter, we examine quantum beats in the 2D spectra of zinc naphthalocyanine (ZnNc) aggregate and monomer, and compare their characteristic features in terms of the frequency and relative phase of diagonal and off-diagonal amplitude oscillations. The longlasting oscillating components ({$>$}1 ps) at 600-700 cm-1 observed in both the aggregate and monomer are found to be attributed to the vibrational coherence. The wide phase variations of the 2D spectral amplitude oscillations are observed not just in the aggregate but also in the monomer state. This suggests that the unusual 90\textdegree{} phase shift may be attributed to neither quantum population-tocoherence transfer nor vibronic exciton coupling.},

  abstract = {Using polarized 2D spectroscopy and state-of-the-art TDDFT calculations to uncover the vibronic structure of primary photosynthetic pigments and its effect on ultrafast photoexcited dynamics.           ,                             Bacteriochlorophyll a (Bchl a) and chlorophyll a (Chl a) play important roles as light absorbers in photosynthetic antennae and participate in the initial charge-separation steps in photosynthetic reaction centers. Despite decades of study, questions remain about the interplay of electronic and vibrational states within the Q-band and its effect on the photoexcited dynamics. Here we report results of polarized two-dimensional electronic spectroscopic measurements, performed on penta-coordinated Bchl a and Chl a and their interpretation based on state-of-the-art time-dependent density functional theory calculations and vibrational mode analysis for spectral shapes. We find that the Q-band of Bchl a is comprised of two independent bands, that are assigned following the Gouterman model to Q               x               and Q               y               states with orthogonal transition dipole moments. However, we measure the angle to be {$\sim$}75\textdegree, a finding that is confirmed by               ab initio               calculations. The internal conversion rate constant from Q               x               to Q               y               is found to be 11 ps               -1               . Unlike Bchl a, the Q-band of Chl a contains three distinct peaks with different polarizations.               Ab initio               calculations trace these features back to a spectral overlap between two electronic transitions and their vibrational replicas. The smaller energy gap and the mixing of vibronic states result in faster internal conversion rate constants of 38\textendash 50 ps               -1               . We analyze the spectra of penta-coordinated Bchl a and Chl a to highlight the interplay between low-lying vibronic states and their relationship to photoinduced relaxation. Our findings shed new light on the photoexcited dynamics in photosynthetic systems where these chromophores are primary pigments.},

  abstract = {The diagonal anharmonicity of an amide I mode of protein backbones plays a critical role in a protein's vibrational dynamics and energy transfer. However, this anharmonicity of long-chain peptides and proteins in H               2               O environment is still lacking. Here, we investigate the anharmonicity of the amide I band of proteins at the lipid membrane/H               2               O interface using a surface-sensitive pump\textendash probe setup in which a femtosecond infrared pump is followed by a femtosecond broadband sum frequency generation vibrational spectroscopy probe. It is found that the anharmonicity of the amide I mode in ideal {$\alpha$}-helical and {$\beta$}-sheet structures at hydrophobic environments is 3\textendash 4~cm               -1               , indicating that the amide I mode in ideal {$\alpha$}-helical and {$\beta$}-sheet structures is delocalized over eight peptide bonds. The anharmonicity increases as the bandwidth of the amide I mode increases due to the exposure of peptide bonds to H               2               O. More H               2               O exposure amounts lead to a larger anharmonicity. The amide I mode of the peptides with large H               2               O exposure amounts is localized in one to two peptide bonds. Our finding reveals that the coupling between the amide I mode and the H               2               O bending mode does not facilitate the delocalization of the amide I mode along the peptide chain, highlighting the impact of H               2               O on energy transfer and structural dynamics of proteins.},

The remarkable efficiency reached in transferring the energy between the collection and storage events recently has been attributed to long-lived electronic coherence present in such antennae systems. We present numerical simulations indicating that the spectroscopic transients that supported this hypothesis are not induced by electronic coherence but instead are caused by vibrational (nuclear) motion in the electronic ground state potential. Besides emphasizing the significance of such nuclear modes, our findings stimulate a reconsideration of the role of electronic coherence in promoting energy transfer in natural photosynthesis. Furthermore, they require us to rethink how energy transfer efficiency is reflected in spectral signals.},

Through numerical calculations, we demonstrate that the range of such spatial coherence continually scales as the 0-0 to 0-1 vibronic peak ratio in time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy. As such, this observable allows one to monitor the coherent evolution of an excited state, displaying the large coherence length following optical excitation, and the subsequent dephasing over time.},

  abstract = {Quantum coherence is proclaimed to promote efficient energy collection by light-harvesting complexes and prototype organic photovoltaics. However, supporting spectroscopic studies are hindered by the problem of distinguishing between the excited state and ground state origin of coherent spectral transients. Coherence amplitude maps, which systematically represent quantum beats observable in two-dimensional (2D) spectroscopy, are currently the prevalent tool for making this distinction. In this article, we present coherence amplitude maps of a molecular dimer, which have become significantly distorted as a result of the finite laser bandwidth used to record the 2D spectra. We argue that under standard spectroscopic conditions similar distortions are to be expected for compounds absorbing over a spectral range similar to, or exceeding, that of the dimer. These include virtually all photovoltaic polymers and certain photosynthetic complexes. With the distortion of coherence amplitude maps, alternative ways to identify quantum coherence are called for. Here, we use numerical simulations that reproduce the essential photophysics of the dimer to unambiguously determine the excited state origin of prominent quantum beats observed in the 2D spectral measurements. This approach is proposed as a dependable method for coherence identification.},

For molecular Haggregates, where this sign is positive, the phase relation of the delocalized two-exciton wave functions causes a destructive interference in the annihilation probability. For J-aggregates, where this sign is negative, the interference is constructive instead; as a result, no such coherent suppression of the annihilation rate occurs. As a consequence, room temperature annihilation rates of typical H- and Jaggregates differ by a factor of {$\sim$}3, while an order of magnitude difference is found for low-temperature aggregates with a low degree of disorder. These findings, which explain experimental observations, reveal a fundamental principle underlying exciton-exciton annihilation, with major implications for technological devices and experimental studies involving high excitation densities.},

  abstract = {The atomic quadrupolar effect in intermolecular electrostatic interactions is studied for chloroform and dichloromethane. From the fitting to the electrostatic potentials around these molecules obtained by ab initio molecular orbital (MO) calculations, atomic quadrupoles of the magnitude as large as Hi1.5ea02 are obtained for the chlorine atoms in these molecules. It is shown that a reasonably good fit to the electric field around the molecules can be obtained only by including those atomic quadrupoles, indicating that atomic quadrupoles are essential for correct representation of the intermolecular electrostatic interactions of these molecules. From the calculations of the radial distribution functions (rdfs) of liquid chloroform and dichloromethane by the Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics methods, it is shown that a significant atomic quadrupolar effect is seen in the rdfs of the C. . .C, C. . .H and H. . .H pairs. The intermolecular distances in the optimized structures of the dimers of chloroform and dichloromethane calculated by the ab initio MO method support the new features in the rdfs of the liquids that are seen upon including the effect of atomic quadrupoles. It is suggested that an atomic quadrupole has a significant effect on the angular (rather than radial) component of the location of the atoms of neighboring molecules.},

  abstract = {It is becoming recognized that the behavior of electrons in hydrogen-bonded systems is far more complicated than previously thought. One key problem would be its relation to the local/extended nature of molecular dipole, i.e., whether it is a true ``molecular'' property. The present study shows, on the basis of analyses of electron densities in water clusters, that the dynamical molecular dipole of water is not enhanced, and is even reduced, upon hydrogen-bond formation because of the electrostatic dragging effect of the electrons of surrounding molecules. As for the static molecular dipole, intermolecular charge transfer occurring upon hydrogen-bond formation is responsible for a significant part of its enhancement. The large difference between these two types of molecular dipole suggests that, for better understanding of the terahertz and dielectric properties of hydrogen-bonded water, where the dynamical molecular dipole is directly involved, the extended nature of the molecular dipoles should be taken into account.},

It is shown that the frequency shift strongly depends on the CO{$\cdot\cdot\cdot$}H angle, with a larger low-frequency shift as the CO{$\cdot\cdot\cdot$}H becomes more bent, suggesting that the so-called hydrated helix with a rather low amide I frequency has an additional water molecule located out-of-plane of the peptide group as compared with a typical {$\alpha$}-helix. The infrared intensity also depends on the angular position of water. A new model parameter set (that can be combined with molecular dynamics) is developed for a more correct representation of the hydration-induced frequency shift. The question regarding the scalar and vectorial nature of the molecular properties related to the frequency shift is also discussed.},

  abstract = {A system with many energy states coupled to a harmonic oscillator bath is considered. To study quantum non-Markovian system-bath dynamics numerically rigorously and nonperturbatively, we developed a computer code for the reduced hierarchy equations of motion (HEOM) for a graphics processor unit (GPU) that can treat the system as large as 4096 energy states. The code employs a Pad\'e spectrum decomposition (PSD) for a construction of HEOM and the exponential integrators. Dynamics of a quantum spin glass system are studied by calculating the free induction decay signal for the cases of 3 \texttimes{} 2 to 3 \texttimes{} 4 triangular lattices with antiferromagnetic interactions. We found that spins relax faster at lower temperature due to transitions through a quantum coherent state, as represented by the offdiagonal elements of the reduced density matrix, while it has been known that the spins relax slower due to suppression of thermal activation in a classical case. The decay of the spins are qualitatively similar regardless of the lattice sizes. The pathway of spin relaxation is analyzed under a sudden temperature drop condition. The Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) based source code used in the present calculations is provided as Supporting Information.},

  abstract = {We present a mixed quantum-classical simulation approach to calculate twodimensional spectra of coupled two-level electronic model systems. We include the change in potential energy of the classical system due to transitions in the quantum system using the Ehrenfest method. We study how this feedback of the quantum system on the classical system influences the shape of two-dimensional spectra. We show that the feedback leads to the expected Stokes shift of the energy levels in the quantum system. This subsequently leads to changes in the population transfer between quantum sites, which in turn influence the intensities of the peaks in two-dimensional spectra. The obtained spectra are compared with spectra calculated using the Hierarchical Equations of Motion method which is exact. While the spectra match perfectly for short waiting times, clear differences are found for longer waiting times. This is attributed to a violation of detailed balance between the quantum states in the Ehrenfest method. The energy of the total quantum-classical system however does obey a Boltzmann distribution, when coupled to a stochastic heat bath.},

  abstract = {We study hydrogen bond dynamics in stereoselectively synthesized polyalcohols by combining linear and two-dimensional (2D) infrared spectroscopy experiments with simulations. We consider two variants of the polyalcohols: the all-syn and all-anti tetrol, which because of their different stereochemistry of the hydroxyl groups form a linear hydrogen-bonded chain that is stable for tens of picoseconds or a system where hydrogen bonds are formed and broken on a picosecond timescale, respectively. The differences in structure and hydrogen bond dynamics gives rise to significant differences in the linear spectra for the two compounds. Furthermore, we show that the stronger hydrogen bonding for the all-syn variant leads to faster fluctuations of the site frequencies than for the all-anti one, which is reflected in the higher degree of homogeneous broadening in the 2D spectra. Because of the different stereochemistry, the coupling in the all-syn molecule is stronger than for the all-anti one, which leads to a faster delocalization of a local excitation. This explains the previously observed pump-frequency independent vibrational lifetime for the all-syn variant, since the excitation loses the memory of the pump frequency before relaxation. For the all-anti form, the coupling is weak and the excitation remains in the initially excited state, maintaining the memory of the pump frequency.},

  abstract = {The Light Harvesting 2 (LH2) complex is a vital part of the photosystem of purple bacteria. It is responsible for the absorption of light and transport of the resulting excitations to the reaction center in a highly efficient manner. A general description of the chromophores and the interaction with their local environment is crucial to understand this highly efficient energy transport. Here we include this interaction in an atomistic way using mixed quantum-classical (molecular dynamics) simulations of spectra. In particular, we present the first atomistic simulation of nonlinear optical spectra for LH2 and use it to study the energy transport within the complex. We show that the frequency distributions of the pigments strongly depend on their positions with respect to the protein scaffold and dynamics of their local environment. Furthermore, we show that although the pigments are closely packed the transition frequencies of neighboring pigments are essentially uncorrelated. We present the simulated linear absorption spectra for the LH2 complex and provide a detailed explanation of the states responsible for the observed two-band structure. Finally, we discuss the energy transfer within the complex by analyzing population transfer calculations and 2D spectra for different waiting times. We conclude that the energy transfer from the B800 ring to the B850 ring is mediated by intermediate states that are delocalized over both rings, allowing for a stepwise downhill energy transport.},

The frequency maps, along with established nearest-neighbor frequency shift and coupling schemes, are then applied to a variety of peptides in aqueous solution and reproduce experimental spectra well. The frequency maps are designed to be transferable to different environments; therefore, they can be used for heterogeneous systems, such as membrane proteins.},

We present a straightforward solution to the problem by introducing a self-consistency test to the well-known fewest switches surface hopping (FSSH) procedure. If the test is failed, the hopping probabilities are corrected with a simple procedure. The novel self-consistent fewest switches surface hopping (SC-FSSH) approach is applied to the Holstein Hamiltonian to study the time-dependence of the electron population. Already in the five-state system, SC-FSSH allows us to reduce the simulation time 104-fold to achieve the FSSH accuracy. The reliable performance and simple formulation of SCFSSH greatly expands the applicability range of the surface hopping method.},

Unlike the standard Tully surface hopping in Hilbert space, which deals with population flow, the new strategy in Liouville space puts population and coherence on equal footing. Dual avoided crossing and energy transfer models show that the accuracy is improved in both diabatic and adiabatic representations and that Liouville space simulation converges faster with the number of trajectories than Hilbert space simulation. The constructed master equation accurately captures superexchange, tunneling, and quantum interference. These effects are essential for charge, phonon and energy transport and scattering, exciton fission and fusion, quantum optics and computing, and many other areas of physics and chemistry.},

FSSH is widely adopted as the fundamental platform to introduce modifications as needed. Significant progress has been made recently to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of the surface hopping technique. Various limitations of the standard FSSHassociated with quantum nuclear effects, interference and decoherence, trivial or ``unavoided'' crossings, superexchange, and representation dependencehave been lifted. These advances are needed to allow one to treat many important phenomena in chemistry, physics, materials, and related disciplines. Examples include charge transport in extended systems such as organic solids, singlet fission in molecular aggregates, Auger-type exciton multiplication, recombination and relaxation in quantum dots and other nanoscale materials, Auger-assisted charge transfer, nonradiative luminescence quenching, and electron-hole recombination. This Perspective summarizes recent advances in the surface hopping formulation of nonadiabatic dynamics and provides an outlook on the future of surface hopping.},

Here, we explore the role that crystal structure plays in the kinetics via fluence dependent transient absorption spectroscopy. We observe stronger saturation of the free carrier concentration under high pump energy density in the orthorhombic phase relative to the tetragonal phase. We attribute this phenomenon to small dielectric constant, large exciton binding energy, and weak Coulomb screening, which results in difficult exciton dissociation under high light intensity in the orthorhombic phase. At higher excitation intensities, we observe a coherent phonon with an oscillation frequency of 23.4 cm-1 at 77 K, whose amplitude tracks the increase of the first-order lifetime.},

The present work describes the development of microscopic polarizable force fields starting with the introduction of these powerful tools and following some of the subsequent developments in the field. Special effort has been made to review a wide range of applications and emphasize cases when the use of polarizable force fields is important.

Light energy is efficiently transferred through chromophore cofactors to the sites, where charge separation occurs. We applied two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy to assess the role of coherences in the photoresponse of the bacterial reaction center of Rhodobacter sphaeroides. By controlling the polarization of the laser beams, we were able to assign unambiguously the oscillatory dynamics to electronic (intermolecular) coherences. The data show that these coherences are sustained for more than 1 ps, indicating that the protein coherently retains some excitation energy on this time scale. Our finding provides a mechanism for effective delocalization of the excitations on the picosecond time scale by electronic coherence, setting the stage for efficient charge separation.},

By combining phase-modulation twodimensional fluorescence spectroscopy (2D FS) with linear absorbance and fluorimetry, we determined that the zinc porphyrin tweezer adopts a mixture of folded and extended conformations in the membrane. By fitting an exciton-coupling model to a series of data sets recorded over a range of temperatures (17-85 \textdegree C) and at different laser center wavelengths, we determined that the folded form of the tweezer is stabilized by a favorable change in the entropy of the local membrane environment. Our results provide insights toward understanding the balance of thermodynamic factors that govern molecular assembly in membranes.},

However, heterogeneous environments usually impede full control and complicate interpretation. Here, we demonstrate photoluminescence-detected ultrafast phase-only coherent control on single organic molecules in a disordered matrix at room temperature. Combined with a multiparameter quantum dynamics identification procedure, we reconstruct multiphoton processes and energy landscapes for each molecule. We find strong phase dependencies of the corresponding transitions into highly excited states. Importantly, also transitions into hidden states, which are not connected to photoluminescent channels, are monitored and controlled. Our combined approach provides a general toolbox to manipulate and understand ultrafast photoinduced processes in single quantum systems, which is a prerequisite to control chemical and biological function.},

We discuss the microscopic processes that give rise to the macroscopic polarization of these materials, ranging from the optical and vibrational response to the transport of ions and electrons. The strong frequency dependence of the dielectric permittivity can be understood by separating the static dielectric constant into its constituents, including the orientational polarization due to rotating dipoles, which connects theory with experimental observations. The controversial issue of ferroelectricity is addressed, where we highlight recent progress in materials and domain characterization but emphasize the challenge associated with isolating spontaneous lattice polarization from other processes such as charged defect formation and transport. We conclude that CH3NH3PbI3 exhibits many features characteristic of a ferroelastic electret, where a spontaneous lattice strain is coupled to long-lived metastable polarization states.},

  abstract = {Infrared spectroscopy is playing an important role in the elucidation of amyloid fiber formation, but the coupling models that link spectra to structure are not well tested for parallel {$\beta$}-sheets. Using a synthetic macrocycle that enforces a two stranded parallel {$\beta$}-sheet conformation, we measured the lifetimes and frequency for six combinations of doubly 13C18O labeled amide I modes using 2D IR spectroscopy. The average vibrational lifetime of the isotope labeled residues was 550 fs. The frequencies of the labels ranged from 1585 to 1595 cm-1, with the largest frequency shift occurring for in-register amino acids. The 2D IR spectra of the coupled isotope labels were calculated from molecular dynamics simulations of a series of macrocycle structures generated from replica exchange dynamics to fully sample the conformational distribution. The models used to simulate the spectra include through-space coupling, through-bond coupling, and local frequency shifts caused by environment electrostatics and hydrogen bonding. The calculated spectra predict the line widths and frequencies nearly quantitatively. Historically, the characteristic features of {$\beta$}-sheet infrared spectra have been attributed to through-space couplings such as transition dipole coupling. We find that frequency shifts of the local carbonyl groups due to nearest neighbor couplings and environmental factors are more important, while the through-space couplings dictate the spectral intensities. As a result, the characteristic absorption spectra empirically used for decades to assign parallel {$\beta$}-sheet secondary structure arises because of a redistribution of oscillator strength, but the through-space couplings do not themselves dramatically alter the frequency distribution of eigenstates much more than already exists in random coil structures. Moreover, solvent exposed residues have amide I bands with {$>$}20 cm-1 line width. Narrower line widths indicate that the amide I backbone is solvent protected inside the macrocycle. This work provides calculated and experimentally verified couplings for parallel {$\beta$}-sheets that can be used in structure-based models to simulate and interpret the infrared spectra of {$\beta$}-sheet containing proteins and protein assemblies, such as amyloid fibers.},

The simulation was based on the configuration distributions generated using the GBOBC implicit solvent model and the integrated tempering sampling (ITS) technique. A soaking procedure was adapted to generate the peptide in explicit solvent configurations for the spectroscopy calculations. The nonlinear exciton propagation (NEP) method was then used to calculate the spectra. Agreeing with the experiments, the intensities and ellipticities of the isotopeshifted peaks in our simulated signals have the site-specific temperature dependences, which suggest the inhomogeneous local thermal stabilities along the peptide chain. Our simulation thus proposes a cost-effective means to understand a peptide's conformational change and related IR spectra across its thermal unfolding transition.},

Rate constants are obtained from short time dynamics performed in both the diabatic and adiabatic basis sets. Numerical results and theoretical analysis show that these two methods can be reasonably accurate in the nonadiabatic limit, by staying close to an approximate Fermi's golden rule. Beyond the nonadiabatic limit, the calculated mixed quantum classical rates are compared with numerical exact results, and similar accuracy was found as in the nonadiabatic limit. The relation between the current finding and recent studies using the surface hopping method based on long time dynamics is also discussed. It is found that the short time dynamics could be more accurate in calculating rate constants using the mixed quantum classical methods.},

The initial oligomer models were built by using the parallel in-register {$\beta$}-sheet fibril structure and then allowed to relax in the simulations. Our simulation results indicated that the stable A{$\beta$}40 monomer was a random coil, while the oligomer structures became more fibril-like with the increase of the peptide strands. Linear absorption and two-dimensional infrared spectra of the isotope-labeled oligomers were calculated and analyzed in detail, which revealed the differential secondary structural features characteristic of A{$\beta$}40 aggregation. A quantitative relation was established to make connection between the calculated spectra and experimental ensemble measurements.},

  abstract = {We describe a computational and experimental approach for probing the binding properties of the RecA protein at the surface of anionic membranes. Fluorescence measurements indicate that RecA behaves differently when bound to phosphatidylglycerol (PG)- and cardiolipin (CL)containing liposomes. We use a multistage computational protocol that integrates an implicit membrane/solvent model, the highly mobile mimetic membrane model, and the full atomistic membrane model to study how different anionic lipids perturb RecA binding to the membrane. With anionic lipids studied here, the binding interface involves three key regions: the N-terminal helix, the DNA binding loop L2, and the M-M7 region. The nature of binding involves both electrostatic interactions between cationic protein residues and lipid polar/charged groups and insertion of hydrophobic residues. The L2 loop contributes more to membrane insertion than the N-terminal helix. More subtle aspects of RecA-membrane interaction are influenced by specific properties of anionic lipids. Ionic hydrogen bonds between the carboxylate group in phosphatidylserine and several lysine residues in the C-terminal region of RecA stabilize the parallel ({$\parallel$}) binding orientation, which is not locally stable on PG- and CL-containing membranes despite similarity in the overall charge density. Lipid packing defects, which are more prevalent in the presence of conical lipids, are observed to enhance the insertion depth of hydrophobic motifs. The computational finding that RecA binds in a similar orientation to PG- and CLcontaining membranes is consistent with the fact that PG alone is sufficient to induce RecA polar localization, although CL might be more effective because of its tighter binding to RecA. The different fluorescence behaviors of RecA upon binding to PG- and CL-containing liposomes is likely due to the different structures and flexibility of the C-terminal region of RecA when it binds to different anionic phospholipids.},

Recently, photolabile siRNAs were developed to elucidate the process of gene silencing in terms of space, time and degree through chemical modification of siRNAs. We report herein a novel type of photolabile siRNA that was synthesized through cyclizing two ends of a single stranded RNA with a photocleavable linker. These circular siRNAs became more resistant to serum degradation. Using reporter assays of firefly/               Renilla               luciferase and GFP/RFP, the gene silencing activities of caged circular siRNAs for both genes were evaluated in HEK293 cells. The results indicated that the target genes were successfully photomodulated using these caged circular siRNAs that were formed by caged circular antisense guide RNAs and their linear complementary sense RNAs. Using the caged circular siRNA targeting GFP, we also successfully achieved photomodulation of GFP expression in mice. Upon further optimization, this new type of caged circular siRNA is expected to be a promising tool for studying gene therapy.},

  abstract = {Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) halide perovskites are the new kids on the block for high-performance perovskite photovoltaics with excellent ambient stability. The layered nature of these perovskites offers an exciting possibility of harnessing their ferroelectric property for photovoltaics. Adjacent polar domains in a ferroelectric material allow the spatial separation of electrons and holes. Presently, the structure-function properties governing the ferroelectric behavior of RP perovskites are an open question. Herein, we realize tunable ferroelectricity in 2-phenylethylammonium (PEA) and methylammonium (MA) RP perovskite (PEA)2(MA){$\overline n-$}1Pb{$\overline n$}I3{$\overline n$}+1. Second harmonic generation (SHG) confirms the noncentrosymmetric nature of these polycrystalline thin films, whereas piezoresponse force microscopy and polarization-electric field measurements validate the microscopic and macroscopic ferroelectric properties. Temperature-dependent SHG and dielectric constant measurements uncover a phase transition temperature at around 170 \textdegree C in these films. Extensive molecular dynamics simulations support the experimental results and identified the correlated reorientation of MA molecules and ion translations as the source of ferroelectricity. Current-voltage characteristics in the dark reveal the persistence of hysteresis in these devices, which has profound implications for light-harvesting and lightemitting applications. Importantly, our findings disclose a viable approach for engineering the ferroelectric properties of RP perovskites that may unlock new functionalities for perovskite optoelectronics.},

Empirical vibrational spectroscopic maps are commonly employed to obtain the instantaneous vibrational frequencies during molecular dynamics simulations but often fail to adequately describe the behavior of these probes, especially in its transferability to a diverse range of environments. In this paper, we demonstrate several reasons for the difficulty in constructing a general-purpose vibrational map for methyl thiocyanate (MeSCN), a model for cyanylated biological probes.

Here, we revisit the coherent dynamics and clarify different types of coherences in the energy transfer processes of LHCII using a joint method of the high-S/N transient grating and two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy. We find that the electronic coherence decays completely within 50~fs at room temperature. The vibrational coherences of chlorophyll a dominate over oscillations within 1~ps, whereas a low-frequency mode of 340~cm               -1               with a vibronic mixing character may participate in vibrationally assisted energy transfer between chlorophylls a. Our results may suggest that vibronic mixing is relevant for rapid energy transfer processes among chlorophylls in LHCII.},
