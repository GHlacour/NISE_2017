\chapter{Information for developers\label{chap:developers}}
Contributions from developers are welcome. The code is available on
github:\\ (https://github.com/GHlacour/NISE\_2017). It is advisable to contact the main developer before planning contributions to avoid competing comtributions. All new techniques should be added in new separate files which are called from the main {\tt NISE.c} code. Implementations should as far as possible make use of existing modules for reading input and data. New propagation schemes or Hamiltonains should be added through the {NISE\_subs.c} modules.
